1
	

I,3,138
	

So foul and fair a day I have not seen.

2
	

I,3,148
	

Speak, if you can: what are you?

3
	

I,3,171
	

Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more:
By Sinel's death I know I am thane of Glamis;
But how of Cawdor? the thane of Cawdor lives,
A prosperous gentleman; and to be king
Stands not within the prospect of belief,
No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence
You owe this strange intelligence? or why
Upon this blasted heath you stop our way
With such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you.

4
	

I,3,183
	

Into the air; and what seem'd corporal melted
As breath into the wind. Would they had stay'd!

5
	

I,3,188
	

Your children shall be kings.

6
	

I,3,190
	

And thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?

7
	

I,3,214
	

The thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me
In borrow'd robes?

8
	

I,3,224
	

[Aside] Glamis, and thane of Cawdor!
The greatest is behind.
[To ROSS and ANGUS]
Thanks for your pains.
[To BANQUO]
Do you not hope your children shall be kings,
When those that gave the thane of Cawdor to me
Promised no less to them?

9
	

I,3,240
	

[Aside]. Two truths are told,
As happy prologues to the swelling act
Of the imperial theme.—I thank you, gentlemen.
[Aside] This supernatural soliciting]
Cannot be ill, cannot be good: if ill,
Why hath it given me earnest of success,
Commencing in a truth? I am thane of Cawdor:
If good, why do I yield to that suggestion
Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair
And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,
Against the use of nature? Present fears
Are less than horrible imaginings:
My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,
Shakes so my single state of man that function
Is smother'd in surmise, and nothing is
But what is not.

10
	

I,3,257
	

[Aside] If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me,
Without my stir.

11
	

I,3,262
	

[Aside] Come what come may,
Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.

12
	

I,3,265
	

Give me your favour: my dull brain was wrought
With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains
Are register'd where every day I turn
The leaf to read them. Let us toward the king.
Think upon what hath chanced, and, at more time,
The interim having weigh'd it, let us speak
Our free hearts each to other.

13
	

I,3,273
	

Till then, enough. Come, friends.

14
	

I,4,301
	

The service and the loyalty I owe,
In doing it, pays itself. Your highness' part
Is to receive our duties; and our duties
Are to your throne and state children and servants,
Which do but what they should, by doing every thing
Safe toward your love and honour.

15
	

I,4,326
	

The rest is labour, which is not used for you:
I'll be myself the harbinger and make joyful
The hearing of my wife with your approach;
So humbly take my leave.

16
	

I,4,331
	

[Aside] The Prince of Cumberland! that is a step
On which I must fall down, or else o'erleap,
For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires;
Let not light see my black and deep desires:
The eye wink at the hand; yet let that be,
Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see.

17
	

I,5,411
	

My dearest love,
Duncan comes here to-night.

18
	

I,5,414
	

To-morrow, as he purposes.

19
	

I,5,426
	

We will speak further.

20
	

I,7,474
	

If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well
It were done quickly: if the assassination
Could trammel up the consequence, and catch
With his surcease success; that but this blow
Might be the be-all and the end-all here,
But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,
We'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases
We still have judgment here; that we but teach
Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return
To plague the inventor: this even-handed justice
Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice
To our own lips. He's here in double trust;
First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,
Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,
Who should against his murderer shut the door,
Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan
Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been
So clear in his great office, that his virtues
Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against
The deep damnation of his taking-off;
And pity, like a naked new-born babe,
Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, horsed
Upon the sightless couriers of the air,
Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,
That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur
To prick the sides of my intent, but only
Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself
And falls on the other.
[Enter LADY MACBETH]
How now! what news?

21
	

I,7,505
	

Hath he ask'd for me?

22
	

I,7,507
	

We will proceed no further in this business:
He hath honour'd me of late; and I have bought
Golden opinions from all sorts of people,
Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,
Not cast aside so soon.

23
	

I,7,523
	

Prithee, peace:
I dare do all that may become a man;
Who dares do more is none.

24
	

I,7,539
	

If we should fail?

25
	

I,7,554
	

Bring forth men-children only;
For thy undaunted mettle should compose
Nothing but males. Will it not be received,
When we have mark'd with blood those sleepy two
Of his own chamber and used their very daggers,
That they have done't?

26
	

I,7,563
	

I am settled, and bend up
Each corporal agent to this terrible feat.
Away, and mock the time with fairest show:
False face must hide what the false heart doth know.

27
	

II,1,582
	

A friend.

28
	

II,1,589
	

Being unprepared,
Our will became the servant to defect;
Which else should free have wrought.

29
	

II,1,595
	

I think not of them:
Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,
We would spend it in some words upon that business,
If you would grant the time.

30
	

II,1,600
	

If you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis,
It shall make honour for you.

31
	

II,1,606
	

Good repose the while!

32
	

II,1,609
	

Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,
She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed.
[Exit Servant]
Is this a dagger which I see before me,
The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee.
I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.
Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible
To feeling as to sight? or art thou but
A dagger of the mind, a false creation,
Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?
I see thee yet, in form as palpable
As this which now I draw.
Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going;
And such an instrument I was to use.
Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses,
Or else worth all the rest; I see thee still,
And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,
Which was not so before. There's no such thing:
It is the bloody business which informs
Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one halfworld
Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse
The curtain'd sleep; witchcraft celebrates
Pale Hecate's offerings, and wither'd murder,
Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf,
Whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace.
With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design
Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,
Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear
Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,
And take the present horror from the time,
Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives:
Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.
[A bell rings]
I go, and it is done; the bell invites me.
Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell
That summons thee to heaven or to hell.

33
	

II,2,657
	

[Within] Who's there? what, ho!

34
	

II,2,665
	

I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise?

35
	

II,2,668
	

When?

36
	

II,2,670
	

As I descended?

37
	

II,2,672
	

Hark!
Who lies i' the second chamber?

38
	

II,2,675
	

This is a sorry sight.

39
	

II,2,678
	

There's one did laugh in's sleep, and one cried
'Murder!'
That they did wake each other: I stood and heard them:
But they did say their prayers, and address'd them
Again to sleep.

40
	

II,2,684
	

One cried 'God bless us!' and 'Amen' the other;
As they had seen me with these hangman's hands.
Listening their fear, I could not say 'Amen,'
When they did say 'God bless us!'

41
	

II,2,689
	

But wherefore could not I pronounce 'Amen'?
I had most need of blessing, and 'Amen'
Stuck in my throat.

42
	

II,2,694
	

Methought I heard a voice cry 'Sleep no more!
Macbeth does murder sleep', the innocent sleep,
Sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleeve of care,
The death of each day's life, sore labour's bath,
Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,
Chief nourisher in life's feast,—

43
	

II,2,701
	

Still it cried 'Sleep no more!' to all the house:
'Glamis hath murder'd sleep, and therefore Cawdor
Shall sleep no more; Macbeth shall sleep no more.'

44
	

II,2,711
	

I'll go no more:
I am afraid to think what I have done;
Look on't again I dare not.

45
	

II,2,721
	

Whence is that knocking?
How is't with me, when every noise appals me?
What hands are here? ha! they pluck out mine eyes.
Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood
Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather
The multitudinous seas in incarnadine,
Making the green one red.

46
	

II,2,742
	

To know my deed, 'twere best not know myself.
[Knocking within]
Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst!

47
	

II,3,808
	

Good morrow, both.

48
	

II,3,810
	

Not yet.

49
	

II,3,813
	

I'll bring you to him.

50
	

II,3,816
	

The labour we delight in physics pain.
This is the door.

51
	

II,3,822
	

He does: he did appoint so.

52
	

II,3,831
	

'Twas a rough night.

53
	

II,3,837
	

[with Lennox] What's the matter.

54
	

II,3,842
	

What is 't you say? the life?

55
	

II,3,874
	

Had I but died an hour before this chance,
I had lived a blessed time; for, from this instant,
There 's nothing serious in mortality:
All is but toys: renown and grace is dead;
The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees
Is left this vault to brag of.

56
	

II,3,882
	

You are, and do not know't:
The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood
Is stopp'd; the very source of it is stopp'd.

57
	

II,3,893
	

O, yet I do repent me of my fury,
That I did kill them.

58
	

II,3,896
	

Who can be wise, amazed, temperate and furious,
Loyal and neutral, in a moment? No man:
The expedition my violent love
Outrun the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan,
His silver skin laced with his golden blood;
And his gash'd stabs look'd like a breach in nature
For ruin's wasteful entrance: there, the murderers,
Steep'd in the colours of their trade, their daggers
Unmannerly breech'd with gore: who could refrain,
That had a heart to love, and in that heart
Courage to make 's love known?

59
	

II,3,929
	

Let's briefly put on manly readiness,
And meet i' the hall together.

60
	

III,1,1014
	

Here's our chief guest.

61
	

III,1,1018
	

To-night we hold a solemn supper sir,
And I'll request your presence.

62
	

III,1,1024
	

Ride you this afternoon?

63
	

III,1,1026
	

We should have else desired your good advice,
Which still hath been both grave and prosperous,
In this day's council; but we'll take to-morrow.
Is't far you ride?

64
	

III,1,1034
	

Fail not our feast.

65
	

III,1,1036
	

We hear, our bloody cousins are bestow'd
In England and in Ireland, not confessing
Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers
With strange invention: but of that to-morrow,
When therewithal we shall have cause of state
Craving us jointly. Hie you to horse: adieu,
Till you return at night. Goes Fleance with you?

66
	

III,1,1044
	

I wish your horses swift and sure of foot;
And so I do commend you to their backs. Farewell.
[Exit BANQUO]
Let every man be master of his time
Till seven at night: to make society
The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself
Till supper-time alone: while then, God be with you!
[Exeunt all but MACBETH, and an attendant]
Sirrah, a word with you: attend those men
Our pleasure?

67
	

III,1,1055
	

Bring them before us.
[Exit Attendant]
To be thus is nothing;
But to be safely thus.—Our fears in Banquo
Stick deep; and in his royalty of nature
Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;
And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,
He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour
To act in safety. There is none but he
Whose being I do fear: and, under him,
My Genius is rebuked; as, it is said,
Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters
When first they put the name of king upon me,
And bade them speak to him: then prophet-like
They hail'd him father to a line of kings:
Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,
And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,
Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,
No son of mine succeeding. If 't be so,
For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind;
For them the gracious Duncan have I murder'd;
Put rancours in the vessel of my peace
Only for them; and mine eternal jewel
Given to the common enemy of man,
To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!
Rather than so, come fate into the list.
And champion me to the utterance! Who's there!
[Re-enter Attendant, with two Murderers]
Now go to the door, and stay there till we call.
[Exit Attendant]
Was it not yesterday we spoke together?

68
	

III,1,1087
	

Well then, now
Have you consider'd of my speeches? Know
That it was he in the times past which held you
So under fortune, which you thought had been
Our innocent self: this I made good to you
In our last conference, pass'd in probation with you,
How you were borne in hand, how cross'd,
the instruments,
Who wrought with them, and all things else that might
To half a soul and to a notion crazed
Say 'Thus did Banquo.'

69
	

III,1,1099
	

I did so, and went further, which is now
Our point of second meeting. Do you find
Your patience so predominant in your nature
That you can let this go? Are you so gospell'd
To pray for this good man and for his issue,
Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave
And beggar'd yours for ever?

70
	

III,1,1107
	

Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men;
As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,
Shoughs, water-rugs and demi-wolves, are clept
All by the name of dogs: the valued file
Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,
The housekeeper, the hunter, every one
According to the gift which bounteous nature
Hath in him closed; whereby he does receive
Particular addition. from the bill
That writes them all alike: and so of men.
Now, if you have a station in the file,
Not i' the worst rank of manhood, say 't;
And I will put that business in your bosoms,
Whose execution takes your enemy off,
Grapples you to the heart and love of us,
Who wear our health but sickly in his life,
Which in his death were perfect.

71
	

III,1,1132
	

Both of you
Know Banquo was your enemy.

72
	

III,1,1135
	

So is he mine; and in such bloody distance,
That every minute of his being thrusts
Against my near'st of life: and though I could
With barefaced power sweep him from my sight
And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,
For certain friends that are both his and mine,
Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall
Who I myself struck down; and thence it is,
That I to your assistance do make love,
Masking the business from the common eye
For sundry weighty reasons.

73
	

III,1,1149
	

Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most
I will advise you where to plant yourselves;
Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time,
The moment on't; for't must be done to-night,
And something from the palace; always thought
That I require a clearness: and with him—
To leave no rubs nor botches in the work—
Fleance his son, that keeps him company,
Whose absence is no less material to me
Than is his father's, must embrace the fate
Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart:
I'll come to you anon.

74
	

III,1,1162
	

I'll call upon you straight: abide within.
[Exeunt Murderers]
It is concluded. Banquo, thy soul's flight,
If it find heaven, must find it out to-night.

75
	

III,2,1184
	

We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it:
She'll close and be herself, whilst our poor malice
Remains in danger of her former tooth.
But let the frame of things disjoint, both the
worlds suffer,
Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep
In the affliction of these terrible dreams
That shake us nightly: better be with the dead,
Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,
Than on the torture of the mind to lie
In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;
After life's fitful fever he sleeps well;
Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,
Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,
Can touch him further.

76
	

III,2,1202
	

So shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you:
Let your remembrance apply to Banquo;
Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue:
Unsafe the while, that we
Must lave our honours in these flattering streams,
And make our faces vizards to our hearts,
Disguising what they are.

77
	

III,2,1210
	

O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!
Thou know'st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives.

78
	

III,2,1213
	

There's comfort yet; they are assailable;
Then be thou jocund: ere the bat hath flown
His cloister'd flight, ere to black Hecate's summons
The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums
Hath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done
A deed of dreadful note.

79
	

III,2,1220
	

Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,
Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,
Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day;
And with thy bloody and invisible hand
Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond
Which keeps me pale! Light thickens; and the crow
Makes wing to the rooky wood:
Good things of day begin to droop and drowse;
While night's black agents to their preys do rouse.
Thou marvell'st at my words: but hold thee still;
Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.
So, prithee, go with me.

80
	

III,4,1272
	

You know your own degrees; sit down: at first
And last the hearty welcome.

81
	

III,4,1275
	

Ourself will mingle with society,
And play the humble host.
Our hostess keeps her state, but in best time
We will require her welcome.

82
	

III,4,1282
	

See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks.
Both sides are even: here I'll sit i' the midst:
Be large in mirth; anon we'll drink a measure
The table round.
[Approaching the door]
There's blood on thy face.

83
	

III,4,1289
	

'Tis better thee without than he within.
Is he dispatch'd?

84
	

III,4,1292
	

Thou art the best o' the cut-throats: yet he's good
That did the like for Fleance: if thou didst it,
Thou art the nonpareil.

85
	

III,4,1297
	

Then comes my fit again: I had else been perfect,
Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,
As broad and general as the casing air:
But now I am cabin'd, cribb'd, confined, bound in
To saucy doubts and fears. But Banquo's safe?

86
	

III,4,1305
	

Thanks for that:
There the grown serpent lies; the worm that's fled
Hath nature that in time will venom breed,
No teeth for the present. Get thee gone: to-morrow
We'll hear, ourselves, again.

87
	

III,4,1317
	

Sweet remembrancer!
Now, good digestion wait on appetite,
And health on both!

88
	

III,4,1323
	

Here had we now our country's honour roof'd,
Were the graced person of our Banquo present;
Who may I rather challenge for unkindness
Than pity for mischance!

89
	

III,4,1330
	

The table's full.

90
	

III,4,1332
	

Where?

91
	

III,4,1334
	

Which of you have done this?

92
	

III,4,1336
	

Thou canst not say I did it: never shake
Thy gory locks at me.

93
	

III,4,1345
	

Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that
Which might appal the devil.

94
	

III,4,1356
	

Prithee, see there! behold! look! lo!
how say you?
Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.
If charnel-houses and our graves must send
Those that we bury back, our monuments
Shall be the maws of kites.

95
	

III,4,1364
	

If I stand here, I saw him.

96
	

III,4,1366
	

Blood hath been shed ere now, i' the olden time,
Ere human statute purged the gentle weal;
Ay, and since too, murders have been perform'd
Too terrible for the ear: the times have been,
That, when the brains were out, the man would die,
And there an end; but now they rise again,
With twenty mortal murders on their crowns,
And push us from our stools: this is more strange
Than such a murder is.

97
	

III,4,1377
	

I do forget.
Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends,
I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing
To those that know me. Come, love and health to all;
Then I'll sit down. Give me some wine; fill full.
I drink to the general joy o' the whole table,
And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss;
Would he were here! to all, and him, we thirst,
And all to all.

98
	

III,4,1388
	

Avaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee!
Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold;
Thou hast no speculation in those eyes
Which thou dost glare with!

99
	

III,4,1395
	

What man dare, I dare:
Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear,
The arm'd rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan tiger;
Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves
Shall never tremble: or be alive again,
And dare me to the desert with thy sword;
If trembling I inhabit then, protest me
The baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow!
Unreal mockery, hence!
[GHOST OF BANQUO vanishes]
Why, so: being gone,
I am a man again. Pray you, sit still.

100
	

III,4,1409
	

Can such things be,
And overcome us like a summer's cloud,
Without our special wonder? You make me strange
Even to the disposition that I owe,
When now I think you can behold such sights,
And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks,
When mine is blanched with fear.

101
	

III,4,1425
	

It will have blood; they say, blood will have blood:
Stones have been known to move and trees to speak;
Augurs and understood relations have
By magot-pies and choughs and rooks brought forth
The secret'st man of blood. What is the night?

102
	

III,4,1431
	

How say'st thou, that Macduff denies his person
At our great bidding?

103
	

III,4,1434
	

I hear it by the way; but I will send:
There's not a one of them but in his house
I keep a servant fee'd. I will to-morrow,
And betimes I will, to the weird sisters:
More shall they speak; for now I am bent to know,
By the worst means, the worst. For mine own good,
All causes shall give way: I am in blood
Stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more,
Returning were as tedious as go o'er:
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand;
Which must be acted ere they may be scann'd.

104
	

III,4,1446
	

Come, we'll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse
Is the initiate fear that wants hard use:
We are yet but young in deed.

105
	

IV,1,1599
	

How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags!
What is't you do?

106
	

IV,1,1602
	

I conjure you, by that which you profess,
Howe'er you come to know it, answer me:
Though you untie the winds and let them fight
Against the churches; though the yesty waves
Confound and swallow navigation up;
Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down;
Though castles topple on their warders' heads;
Though palaces and pyramids do slope
Their heads to their foundations; though the treasure
Of nature's germens tumble all together,
Even till destruction sicken; answer me
To what I ask you.

107
	

IV,1,1619
	

Call 'em; let me see 'em.

108
	

IV,1,1627
	

Tell me, thou unknown power,—

109
	

IV,1,1633
	

Whate'er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks;
Thou hast harp'd my fear aright: but one
word more,—

110
	

IV,1,1640
	

Had I three ears, I'ld hear thee.

111
	

IV,1,1645
	

Then live, Macduff: what need I fear of thee?
But yet I'll make assurance double sure,
And take a bond of fate: thou shalt not live;
That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies,
And sleep in spite of thunder.
[Thunder. Third Apparition: a Child crowned, with a tree in his hand]
What is this
That rises like the issue of a king,
And wears upon his baby-brow the round
And top of sovereignty?

112
	

IV,1,1662
	

That will never be
Who can impress the forest, bid the tree
Unfix his earth-bound root? Sweet bodements! good!
Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
Of Birnam rise, and our high-placed Macbeth
Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath
To time and mortal custom. Yet my heart
Throbs to know one thing: tell me, if your art
Can tell so much: shall Banquo's issue ever
Reign in this kingdom?

113
	

IV,1,1673
	

I will be satisfied: deny me this,
And an eternal curse fall on you! Let me know.
Why sinks that cauldron? and what noise is this?

114
	

IV,1,1684
	

Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo: down!
Thy crown does sear mine eye-balls. And thy hair,
Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first.
A third is like the former. Filthy hags!
Why do you show me this? A fourth! Start, eyes!
What, will the line stretch out to the crack of doom?
Another yet! A seventh! I'll see no more:
And yet the eighth appears, who bears a glass
Which shows me many more; and some I see
That two-fold balls and treble scepters carry:
Horrible sight! Now, I see, 'tis true;
For the blood-bolter'd Banquo smiles upon me,
And points at them for his.
[Apparitions vanish]
What, is this so?

115
	

IV,1,1708
	

Where are they? Gone? Let this pernicious hour
Stand aye accursed in the calendar!
Come in, without there!

116
	

IV,1,1713
	

Saw you the weird sisters?

117
	

IV,1,1715
	

Came they not by you?

118
	

IV,1,1717
	

Infected be the air whereon they ride;
And damn'd all those that trust them! I did hear
The galloping of horse: who was't came by?

119
	

IV,1,1722
	

Fled to England!

120
	

IV,1,1724
	

Time, thou anticipatest my dread exploits:
The flighty purpose never is o'ertook
Unless the deed go with it; from this moment
The very firstlings of my heart shall be
The firstlings of my hand. And even now,
To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and done:
The castle of Macduff I will surprise;
Seize upon Fife; give to the edge o' the sword
His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls
That trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool;
This deed I'll do before this purpose cool.
But no more sights!—Where are these gentlemen?
Come, bring me where they are.

121
	

V,3,2246
	

Bring me no more reports; let them fly all:
Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane,
I cannot taint with fear. What's the boy Malcolm?
Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know
All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus:
'Fear not, Macbeth; no man that's born of woman
Shall e'er have power upon thee.' Then fly,
false thanes,
And mingle with the English epicures:
The mind I sway by and the heart I bear
Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.
[Enter a Servant]
The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon!
Where got'st thou that goose look?

122
	

V,3,2261
	

Geese, villain!

123
	

V,3,2263
	

Go prick thy face, and over-red thy fear,
Thou lily-liver'd boy. What soldiers, patch?
Death of thy soul! those linen cheeks of thine
Are counsellors to fear. What soldiers, whey-face?

124
	

V,3,2268
	

Take thy face hence.
[Exit Servant]
Seyton!—I am sick at heart,
When I behold—Seyton, I say!—This push
Will cheer me ever, or disseat me now.
I have lived long enough: my way of life
Is fall'n into the sear, the yellow leaf;
And that which should accompany old age,
As honour, love, obedience, troops of friends,
I must not look to have; but, in their stead,
Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honour, breath,
Which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not. Seyton!

125
	

V,3,2282
	

What news more?

126
	

V,3,2284
	

I'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack'd.
Give me my armour.

127
	

V,3,2287
	

I'll put it on.
Send out more horses; skirr the country round;
Hang those that talk of fear. Give me mine armour.
How does your patient, doctor?

128
	

V,3,2294
	

Cure her of that.
Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased,
Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,
Raze out the written troubles of the brain
And with some sweet oblivious antidote
Cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff
Which weighs upon the heart?

129
	

V,3,2303
	

Throw physic to the dogs; I'll none of it.
Come, put mine armour on; give me my staff.
Seyton, send out. Doctor, the thanes fly from me.
Come, sir, dispatch. If thou couldst, doctor, cast
The water of my land, find her disease,
And purge it to a sound and pristine health,
I would applaud thee to the very echo,
That should applaud again.—Pull't off, I say.—
What rhubarb, cyme, or what purgative drug,
Would scour these English hence? Hear'st thou of them?

130
	

V,3,2315
	

Bring it after me.
I will not be afraid of death and bane,
Till Birnam forest come to Dunsinane.

131
	

V,5,2353
	

Hang out our banners on the outward walls;
The cry is still 'They come:' our castle's strength
Will laugh a siege to scorn: here let them lie
Till famine and the ague eat them up:
Were they not forced with those that should be ours,
We might have met them dareful, beard to beard,
And beat them backward home.
[A cry of women within]
What is that noise?

132
	

V,5,2364
	

I have almost forgot the taste of fears;
The time has been, my senses would have cool'd
To hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hair
Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir
As life were in't: I have supp'd full with horrors;
Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts
Cannot once start me.
[Re-enter SEYTON]
Wherefore was that cry?

133
	

V,5,2374
	

She should have died hereafter;
There would have been a time for such a word.
To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
To the last syllable of recorded time,
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
And then is heard no more: it is a tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
Signifying nothing.
[Enter a Messenger]
Thou comest to use thy tongue; thy story quickly.

134
	

V,5,2391
	

Well, say, sir.

135
	

V,5,2395
	

Liar and slave!

136
	

V,5,2399
	

If thou speak'st false,
Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,
Till famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth,
I care not if thou dost for me as much.
I pull in resolution, and begin
To doubt the equivocation of the fiend
That lies like truth: 'Fear not, till Birnam wood
Do come to Dunsinane:' and now a wood
Comes toward Dunsinane. Arm, arm, and out!
If this which he avouches does appear,
There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.
I gin to be aweary of the sun,
And wish the estate o' the world were now undone.
Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
At least we'll die with harness on our back.

137
	

V,7,2430
	

They have tied me to a stake; I cannot fly,
But, bear-like, I must fight the course. What's he
That was not born of woman? Such a one
Am I to fear, or none.

138
	

V,7,2436
	

Thou'lt be afraid to hear it.

139
	

V,7,2439
	

My name's Macbeth.

140
	

V,7,2442
	

No, nor more fearful.

141
	

V,7,2446
	

Thou wast born of woman
But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,
Brandish'd by man that's of a woman born.

142
	

V,8,2473
	

Why should I play the Roman fool, and die
On mine own sword? whiles I see lives, the gashes
Do better upon them.

143
	

V,8,2478
	

Of all men else I have avoided thee:
But get thee back; my soul is too much charged
With blood of thine already.

144
	

V,8,2485
	

Thou losest labour:
As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air
With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed:
Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;
I bear a charmed life, which must not yield,
To one of woman born.

145
	

V,8,2495
	

Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,
For it hath cow'd my better part of man!
And be these juggling fiends no more believed,
That palter with us in a double sense;
That keep the word of promise to our ear,
And break it to our hope. I'll not fight with thee.

146
	

V,8,2506
	

I will not yield,
To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet,
And to be baited with the rabble's curse.
Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane,
And thou opposed, being of no woman born,
Yet I will try the last. Before my body
I throw my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff,
And damn'd be him that first cries, 'Hold, enough!'
[Exeunt, fighting. Alarums]
[Retreat. Flourish. Enter, with drum and colours,]

I,3,139
	

How far is't call'd to Forres? What are these
So wither'd and so wild in their attire,
That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,
And yet are on't? Live you? or are you aught
That man may question? You seem to understand me,
By each at once her chappy finger laying
Upon her skinny lips: you should be women,
And yet your beards forbid me to interpret
That you are so.

2
	

I,3,152
	

Good sir, why do you start; and seem to fear
Things that do sound so fair? I' the name of truth,
Are ye fantastical, or that indeed
Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner
You greet with present grace and great prediction
Of noble having and of royal hope,
That he seems rapt withal: to me you speak not.
If you can look into the seeds of time,
And say which grain will grow and which will not,
Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear
Your favours nor your hate.

3
	

I,3,181
	

The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,
And these are of them. Whither are they vanish'd?

4
	

I,3,185
	

Were such things here as we do speak about?
Or have we eaten on the insane root
That takes the reason prisoner?

5
	

I,3,189
	

You shall be king.

6
	

I,3,191
	

To the selfsame tune and words. Who's here?

7
	

I,3,213
	

What, can the devil speak true?

8
	

I,3,232
	

That trusted home
Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,
Besides the thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:
And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,
The instruments of darkness tell us truths,
Win us with honest trifles, to betray's
In deepest consequence.
Cousins, a word, I pray you.

9
	

I,3,256
	

Look, how our partner's rapt.

10
	

I,3,259
	

New horrors come upon him,
Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould
But with the aid of use.

11
	

I,3,264
	

Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.

12
	

I,3,272
	

Very gladly.

13
	

I,4,313
	

There if I grow,
The harvest is your own.

14
	

I,6,436
	

This guest of summer,
The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,
By his loved mansionry, that the heaven's breath
Smells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze,
Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird
Hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle:
Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed,
The air is delicate.

15
	

II,1,569
	

How goes the night, boy?

16
	

II,1,571
	

And she goes down at twelve.

17
	

II,1,573
	

Hold, take my sword. There's husbandry in heaven;
Their candles are all out. Take thee that too.
A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,
And yet I would not sleep: merciful powers,
Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature
Gives way to in repose!
[Enter MACBETH, and a Servant with a torch]
Give me my sword.
Who's there?

18
	

II,1,583
	

What, sir, not yet at rest? The king's a-bed:
He hath been in unusual pleasure, and
Sent forth great largess to your offices.
This diamond he greets your wife withal,
By the name of most kind hostess; and shut up
In measureless content.

19
	

II,1,592
	

All's well.
I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters:
To you they have show'd some truth.

20
	

II,1,599
	

At your kind'st leisure.

21
	

II,1,602
	

So I lose none
In seeking to augment it, but still keep
My bosom franchised and allegiance clear,
I shall be counsell'd.

22
	

II,1,607
	

Thanks, sir: the like to you!

23
	

II,3,870
	

Too cruel any where.
Dear Duff, I prithee, contradict thyself,
And say it is not so.

24
	

II,3,918
	

Look to the lady:
[LADY MACBETH is carried out]
And when we have our naked frailties hid,
That suffer in exposure, let us meet,
And question this most bloody piece of work,
To know it further. Fears and scruples shake us:
In the great hand of God I stand; and thence
Against the undivulged pretence I fight
Of treasonous malice.

25
	

III,1,1002
	

Thou hast it now: king, Cawdor, Glamis, all,
As the weird women promised, and, I fear,
Thou play'dst most foully for't: yet it was said
It should not stand in thy posterity,
But that myself should be the root and father
Of many kings. If there come truth from them—
As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine—
Why, by the verities on thee made good,
May they not be my oracles as well,
And set me up in hope? But hush! no more.
[Sennet sounded. Enter MACBETH, as king, LADY]
MACBETH, as queen, LENNOX, ROSS, Lords, Ladies, and Attendants]

26
	

III,1,1020
	

Let your highness
Command upon me; to the which my duties
Are with a most indissoluble tie
For ever knit.

27
	

III,1,1025
	

Ay, my good lord.

28
	

III,1,1030
	

As far, my lord, as will fill up the time
'Twixt this and supper: go not my horse the better,
I must become a borrower of the night
For a dark hour or twain.

29
	

III,1,1035
	

My lord, I will not.

30
	

III,1,1043
	

Ay, my good lord: our time does call upon 's.

31
	

III,3,1245
	

[Within] Give us a light there, ho!

32
	

III,3,1257
	

It will be rain to-night.

33
	

III,3,1260
	

O, treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!
Thou mayst revenge. O slave!

MALCOMMALCOM

I,2,21
	

This is the sergeant
Who like a good and hardy soldier fought
'Gainst my captivity. Hail, brave friend!
Say to the king the knowledge of the broil
As thou didst leave it.

2
	

I,2,69
	

The worthy thane of Ross.

3
	

I,4,278
	

My liege,
They are not yet come back. But I have spoke
With one that saw him die: who did report
That very frankly he confess'd his treasons,
Implored your highness' pardon and set forth
A deep repentance: nothing in his life
Became him like the leaving it; he died
As one that had been studied in his death
To throw away the dearest thing he owed,
As 'twere a careless trifle.

4
	

II,3,886
	

O, by whom?

5
	

II,3,909
	

[Aside to DONALBAIN] Why do we hold our tongues,
That most may claim this argument for ours?

6
	

II,3,916
	

[Aside to DONALBAIN] Nor our strong sorrow
Upon the foot of motion.

7
	

II,3,933
	

What will you do? Let's not consort with them:
To show an unfelt sorrow is an office
Which the false man does easy. I'll to England.

8
	

II,3,940
	

This murderous shaft that's shot
Hath not yet lighted, and our safest way
Is to avoid the aim. Therefore, to horse;
And let us not be dainty of leave-taking,
But shift away: there's warrant in that theft
Which steals itself, when there's no mercy left.

9
	

IV,3,1842
	

Let us seek out some desolate shade, and there
Weep our sad bosoms empty.

10
	

IV,3,1851
	

What I believe I'll wail,
What know believe, and what I can redress,
As I shall find the time to friend, I will.
What you have spoke, it may be so perchance.
This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,
Was once thought honest: you have loved him well.
He hath not touch'd you yet. I am young;
but something
You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom
To offer up a weak poor innocent lamb
To appease an angry god.

11
	

IV,3,1863
	

But Macbeth is.
A good and virtuous nature may recoil
In an imperial charge. But I shall crave
your pardon;
That which you are my thoughts cannot transpose:
Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell;
Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,
Yet grace must still look so.

12
	

IV,3,1872
	

Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.
Why in that rawness left you wife and child,
Those precious motives, those strong knots of love,
Without leave-taking? I pray you,
Let not my jealousies be your dishonours,
But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,
Whatever I shall think.

13
	

IV,3,1887
	

Be not offended:
I speak not as in absolute fear of you.
I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;
It weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash
Is added to her wounds: I think withal
There would be hands uplifted in my right;
And here from gracious England have I offer
Of goodly thousands: but, for all this,
When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head,
Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country
Shall have more vices than it had before,
More suffer and more sundry ways than ever,
By him that shall succeed.

14
	

IV,3,1901
	

It is myself I mean: in whom I know
All the particulars of vice so grafted
That, when they shall be open'd, black Macbeth
Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state
Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
With my confineless harms.

15
	

IV,3,1910
	

I grant him bloody,
Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,
Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin
That has a name: but there's no bottom, none,
In my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,
Your matrons and your maids, could not fill up
The cistern of my lust, and my desire
All continent impediments would o'erbear
That did oppose my will: better Macbeth
Than such an one to reign.

16
	

IV,3,1931
	

With this there grows
In my most ill-composed affection such
A stanchless avarice that, were I king,
I should cut off the nobles for their lands,
Desire his jewels and this other's house:
And my more-having would be as a sauce
To make me hunger more; that I should forge
Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,
Destroying them for wealth.

17
	

IV,3,1947
	

But I have none: the king-becoming graces,
As justice, verity, temperance, stableness,
Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,
Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,
I have no relish of them, but abound
In the division of each several crime,
Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should
Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,
Uproar the universal peace, confound
All unity on earth.

18
	

IV,3,1958
	

If such a one be fit to govern, speak:
I am as I have spoken.

19
	

IV,3,1973
	

Macduff, this noble passion,
Child of integrity, hath from my soul
Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts
To thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth
By many of these trains hath sought to win me
Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me
From over-credulous haste: but God above
Deal between thee and me! for even now
I put myself to thy direction, and
Unspeak mine own detraction, here abjure
The taints and blames I laid upon myself,
For strangers to my nature. I am yet
Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,
Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,
At no time broke my faith, would not betray
The devil to his fellow and delight
No less in truth than life: my first false speaking
Was this upon myself: what I am truly,
Is thine and my poor country's to command:
Whither indeed, before thy here-approach,
Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,
Already at a point, was setting forth.
Now we'll together; and the chance of goodness
Be like our warranted quarrel! Why are you silent?

20
	

IV,3,2000
	

Well; more anon.—Comes the king forth, I pray you?

21
	

IV,3,2006
	

I thank you, doctor.

22
	

IV,3,2009
	

'Tis call'd the evil:
A most miraculous work in this good king;
Which often, since my here-remain in England,
I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,
Himself best knows: but strangely-visited people,
All swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,
The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,
Put on with holy prayers: and 'tis spoken,
To the succeeding royalty he leaves
The healing benediction. With this strange virtue,
He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy,
And sundry blessings hang about his throne,
That speak him full of grace.

23
	

IV,3,2025
	

My countryman; but yet I know him not.

24
	

IV,3,2027
	

I know him now. Good God, betimes remove
The means that makes us strangers!

25
	

IV,3,2043
	

What's the newest grief?

26
	

IV,3,2061
	

Be't their comfort
We are coming thither: gracious England hath
Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men;
An older and a better soldier none
That Christendom gives out.

27
	

IV,3,2086
	

Merciful heaven!
What, man! ne'er pull your hat upon your brows;
Give sorrow words: the grief that does not speak
Whispers the o'er-fraught heart and bids it break.

28
	

IV,3,2096
	

Be comforted:
Let's make us medicines of our great revenge,
To cure this deadly grief.

29
	

IV,3,2103
	

Dispute it like a man.

30
	

IV,3,2112
	

Be this the whetstone of your sword: let grief
Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.

31
	

IV,3,2120
	

This tune goes manly.
Come, go we to the king; our power is ready;
Our lack is nothing but our leave; Macbeth
Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above
Put on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may:
The night is long that never finds the day.

32
	

V,4,2324
	

Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand
That chambers will be safe.

33
	

V,4,2329
	

Let every soldier hew him down a bough
And bear't before him: thereby shall we shadow
The numbers of our host and make discovery
Err in report of us.

34
	

V,4,2337
	

'Tis his main hope:
For where there is advantage to be given,
Both more and less have given him the revolt,
And none serve with him but constrained things
Whose hearts are absent too.

35
	

V,6,2417
	

Now near enough: your leafy screens throw down.
And show like those you are. You, worthy uncle,
Shall, with my cousin, your right-noble son,
Lead our first battle: worthy Macduff and we
Shall take upon 's what else remains to do,
According to our order.

36
	

V,7,2468
	

We have met with foes
That strike beside us.

37
	

V,8,2517
	

I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.

38
	

V,8,2520
	

Macduff is missing, and your noble son.

39
	

V,8,2536
	

He's worth more sorrow,
And that I'll spend for him.

40
	

V,8,2550
	

We shall not spend a large expense of time
Before we reckon with your several loves,
And make us even with you. My thanes and kinsmen,
Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland
In such an honour named. What's more to do,
Which would be planted newly with the time,
As calling home our exiled friends abroad
That fled the snares of watchful tyranny;
Producing forth the cruel ministers
Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen,
Who, as 'tis thought, by self and violent hands
Took off her life; this, and what needful else
That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace,
We will perform in measure, time and place:
So, thanks to all at once and to each one,
Whom we invite to see us crown'd at Scone.

I,5,345
	

'They met me in the day of success: and I have
learned by the perfectest report, they have more in
them than mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire
to question them further, they made themselves air,
into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in
the wonder of it, came missives from the king, who
all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor;' by which title,
before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referred
me to the coming on of time, with 'Hail, king that
shalt be!' This have I thought good to deliver
thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou
mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being
ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it
to thy heart, and farewell.'
Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be
What thou art promised: yet do I fear thy nature;
It is too full o' the milk of human kindness
To catch the nearest way: thou wouldst be great;
Art not without ambition, but without
The illness should attend it: what thou wouldst highly,
That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,
And yet wouldst wrongly win: thou'ldst have, great Glamis,
That which cries 'Thus thou must do, if thou have it;
And that which rather thou dost fear to do
Than wishest should be undone.' Hie thee hither,
That I may pour my spirits in thine ear;
And chastise with the valour of my tongue
All that impedes thee from the golden round,
Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem
To have thee crown'd withal.
[Enter a Messenger]
What is your tidings?

2
	

I,5,378
	

Thou'rt mad to say it:
Is not thy master with him? who, were't so,
Would have inform'd for preparation.

3
	

I,5,385
	

Give him tending;
He brings great news.
[Exit Messenger]
The raven himself is hoarse
That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan
Under my battlements. Come, you spirits
That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,
And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full
Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood;
Stop up the access and passage to remorse,
That no compunctious visitings of nature
Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between
The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,
And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers,
Wherever in your sightless substances
You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night,
And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,
That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,
Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark,
To cry 'Hold, hold!'
[Enter MACBETH]
Great Glamis! worthy Cawdor!
Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!
Thy letters have transported me beyond
This ignorant present, and I feel now
The future in the instant.

4
	

I,5,413
	

And when goes hence?

5
	

I,5,415
	

O, never
Shall sun that morrow see!
Your face, my thane, is as a book where men
May read strange matters. To beguile the time,
Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,
Your hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower,
But be the serpent under't. He that's coming
Must be provided for: and you shall put
This night's great business into my dispatch;
Which shall to all our nights and days to come
Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.

6
	

I,5,427
	

Only look up clear;
To alter favour ever is to fear:
Leave all the rest to me.

7
	

I,6,450
	

All our service
In every point twice done and then done double
Were poor and single business to contend
Against those honours deep and broad wherewith
Your majesty loads our house: for those of old,
And the late dignities heap'd up to them,
We rest your hermits.

8
	

I,6,463
	

Your servants ever
Have theirs, themselves and what is theirs, in compt,
To make their audit at your highness' pleasure,
Still to return your own.

9
	

I,7,504
	

He has almost supp'd: why have you left the chamber?

10
	

I,7,506
	

Know you not he has?

11
	

I,7,512
	

Was the hope drunk
Wherein you dress'd yourself? hath it slept since?
And wakes it now, to look so green and pale
At what it did so freely? From this time
Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard
To be the same in thine own act and valour
As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that
Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life,
And live a coward in thine own esteem,
Letting 'I dare not' wait upon 'I would,'
Like the poor cat i' the adage?

12
	

I,7,526
	

What beast was't, then,
That made you break this enterprise to me?
When you durst do it, then you were a man;
And, to be more than what you were, you would
Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place
Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:
They have made themselves, and that their fitness now
Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know
How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me:
I would, while it was smiling in my face,
Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,
And dash'd the brains out, had I so sworn as you
Have done to this.

13
	

I,7,540
	

We fail!
But screw your courage to the sticking-place,
And we'll not fail. When Duncan is asleep—
Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey
Soundly invite him—his two chamberlains
Will I with wine and wassail so convince
That memory, the warder of the brain,
Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason
A limbeck only: when in swinish sleep
Their drenched natures lie as in a death,
What cannot you and I perform upon
The unguarded Duncan? what not put upon
His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt
Of our great quell?

14
	

I,7,560
	

Who dares receive it other,
As we shall make our griefs and clamour roar
Upon his death?

15
	

II,2,647
	

That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold;
What hath quench'd them hath given me fire.
Hark! Peace!
It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman,
Which gives the stern'st good-night. He is about it:
The doors are open; and the surfeited grooms
Do mock their charge with snores: I have drugg'd
their possets,
That death and nature do contend about them,
Whether they live or die.

16
	

II,2,658
	

Alack, I am afraid they have awaked,
And 'tis not done. The attempt and not the deed
Confounds us. Hark! I laid their daggers ready;
He could not miss 'em. Had he not resembled
My father as he slept, I had done't.
[Enter MACBETH]
My husband!

17
	

II,2,666
	

I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.
Did not you speak?

18
	

II,2,669
	

Now.

19
	

II,2,671
	

Ay.

20
	

II,2,674
	

Donalbain.

21
	

II,2,677
	

A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.

22
	

II,2,683
	

There are two lodged together.

23
	

II,2,688
	

Consider it not so deeply.

24
	

II,2,692
	

These deeds must not be thought
After these ways; so, it will make us mad.

25
	

II,2,700
	

What do you mean?

26
	

II,2,704
	

Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane,
You do unbend your noble strength, to think
So brainsickly of things. Go get some water,
And wash this filthy witness from your hand.
Why did you bring these daggers from the place?
They must lie there: go carry them; and smear
The sleepy grooms with blood.

27
	

II,2,714
	

Infirm of purpose!
Give me the daggers: the sleeping and the dead
Are but as pictures: 'tis the eye of childhood
That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,
I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal;
For it must seem their guilt.

28
	

II,2,729
	

My hands are of your colour; but I shame
To wear a heart so white.
[Knocking within]
I hear a knocking
At the south entry: retire we to our chamber;
A little water clears us of this deed:
How easy is it, then! Your constancy
Hath left you unattended.
[Knocking within]
Hark! more knocking.
Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us,
And show us to be watchers. Be not lost
So poorly in your thoughts.

29
	

II,3,858
	

What's the business,
That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley
The sleepers of the house? speak, speak!

30
	

II,3,868
	

Woe, alas!
What, in our house?

31
	

II,3,907
	

Help me hence, ho!

32
	

III,1,1015
	

If he had been forgotten,
It had been as a gap in our great feast,
And all-thing unbecoming.

33
	

III,2,1168
	

Is Banquo gone from court?

34
	

III,2,1170
	

Say to the king, I would attend his leisure
For a few words.

35
	

III,2,1174
	

Nought's had, all's spent,
Where our desire is got without content:
'Tis safer to be that which we destroy
Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.
[Enter MACBETH]
How now, my lord! why do you keep alone,
Of sorriest fancies your companions making,
Using those thoughts which should indeed have died
With them they think on? Things without all remedy
Should be without regard: what's done is done.

36
	

III,2,1199
	

Come on;
Gentle my lord, sleek o'er your rugged looks;
Be bright and jovial among your guests to-night.

37
	

III,2,1209
	

You must leave this.

38
	

III,2,1212
	

But in them nature's copy's not eterne.

39
	

III,2,1219
	

What's to be done?

40
	

III,4,1279
	

Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends;
For my heart speaks they are welcome.

41
	

III,4,1311
	

My royal lord,
You do not give the cheer: the feast is sold
That is not often vouch'd, while 'tis a-making,
'Tis given with welcome: to feed were best at home;
From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony;
Meeting were bare without it.

42
	

III,4,1339
	

Sit, worthy friends: my lord is often thus,
And hath been from his youth: pray you, keep seat;
The fit is momentary; upon a thought
He will again be well: if much you note him,
You shall offend him and extend his passion:
Feed, and regard him not. Are you a man?

43
	

III,4,1347
	

O proper stuff!
This is the very painting of your fear:
This is the air-drawn dagger which, you said,
Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,
Impostors to true fear, would well become
A woman's story at a winter's fire,
Authorized by her grandam. Shame itself!
Why do you make such faces? When all's done,
You look but on a stool.

44
	

III,4,1363
	

What, quite unmann'd in folly?

45
	

III,4,1365
	

Fie, for shame!

46
	

III,4,1375
	

My worthy lord,
Your noble friends do lack you.

47
	

III,4,1392
	

Think of this, good peers,
But as a thing of custom: 'tis no other;
Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.

48
	

III,4,1407
	

You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting,
With most admired disorder.

49
	

III,4,1417
	

I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse;
Question enrages him. At once, good night:
Stand not upon the order of your going,
But go at once.

50
	

III,4,1423
	

A kind good night to all!

51
	

III,4,1430
	

Almost at odds with morning, which is which.

52
	

III,4,1433
	

Did you send to him, sir?

53
	

III,4,1445
	

You lack the season of all natures, sleep.

54
	

V,1,2156
	

Yet here's a spot.

55
	

V,1,2159
	

Out, damned spot! out, I say!—One: two: why,
then, 'tis time to do't.—Hell is murky!—Fie, my
lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we
fear who knows it, when none can call our power to
account?—Yet who would have thought the old man
to have had so much blood in him.

56
	

V,1,2166
	

The thane of Fife had a wife: where is she now?—
What, will these hands ne'er be clean?—No more o'
that, my lord, no more o' that: you mar all with
this starting.

57
	

V,1,2173
	

Here's the smell of the blood still: all the
perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little
hand. Oh, oh, oh!

58
	

V,1,2184
	

Wash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not so
pale.—I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried; he
cannot come out on's grave.

59
	

V,1,2188
	

To bed, to bed! there's knocking at the gate:
come, come, come, come, give me your hand. What's
done cannot be undone.—To bed, to bed, to bed!

II,3,782
	

Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed,
That you do lie so late?

2
	

II,3,787
	

What three things does drink especially provoke?

3
	

II,3,798
	

I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.

4
	

II,3,804
	

Is thy master stirring?
[Enter MACBETH]
Our knocking has awaked him; here he comes.

5
	

II,3,809
	

Is the king stirring, worthy thane?

6
	

II,3,811
	

He did command me to call timely on him:
I have almost slipp'd the hour.

7
	

II,3,814
	

I know this is a joyful trouble to you;
But yet 'tis one.

8
	

II,3,818
	

I'll make so bold to call,
For 'tis my limited service.

9
	

II,3,835
	

O horror, horror, horror! Tongue nor heart
Cannot conceive nor name thee!

10
	

II,3,838
	

Confusion now hath made his masterpiece!
Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope
The Lord's anointed temple, and stole thence
The life o' the building!

11
	

II,3,844
	

Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight
With a new Gorgon: do not bid me speak;
See, and then speak yourselves.
[Exeunt MACBETH and LENNOX]
Awake, awake!
Ring the alarum-bell. Murder and treason!
Banquo and Donalbain! Malcolm! awake!
Shake off this downy sleep, death's counterfeit,
And look on death itself! up, up, and see
The great doom's image! Malcolm! Banquo!
As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites,
To countenance this horror! Ring the bell.

12
	

II,3,861
	

O gentle lady,
'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak:
The repetition, in a woman's ear,
Would murder as it fell.
[Enter BANQUO]
O Banquo, Banquo,
Our royal master 's murder'd!

13
	

II,3,885
	

Your royal father 's murder'd.

14
	

II,3,895
	

Wherefore did you so?

15
	

II,3,908
	

Look to the lady.

16
	

II,3,927
	

And so do I.

17
	

II,4,973
	

Why, see you not?

18
	

II,4,975
	

Those that Macbeth hath slain.

19
	

II,4,978
	

They were suborn'd:
Malcolm and Donalbain, the king's two sons,
Are stol'n away and fled; which puts upon them
Suspicion of the deed.

20
	

II,4,986
	

He is already named, and gone to Scone
To be invested.

21
	

II,4,989
	

Carried to Colmekill,
The sacred storehouse of his predecessors,
And guardian of their bones.

22
	

II,4,993
	

No, cousin, I'll to Fife.

23
	

II,4,995
	

Well, may you see things well done there: adieu!
Lest our old robes sit easier than our new!

24
	

IV,3,1844
	

Let us rather
Hold fast the mortal sword, and like good men
Bestride our down-fall'n birthdom: each new morn
New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows
Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds
As if it felt with Scotland and yell'd out
Like syllable of dolour.

25
	

IV,3,1862
	

I am not treacherous.

26
	

IV,3,1871
	

I have lost my hopes.

27
	

IV,3,1879
	

Bleed, bleed, poor country!
Great tyranny! lay thou thy basis sure,
For goodness dare not cheque thee: wear thou
thy wrongs;
The title is affeer'd! Fare thee well, lord:
I would not be the villain that thou think'st
For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp,
And the rich East to boot.

28
	

IV,3,1900
	

What should he be?

29
	

IV,3,1907
	

Not in the legions
Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn'd
In evils to top Macbeth.

30
	

IV,3,1920
	

Boundless intemperance
In nature is a tyranny; it hath been
The untimely emptying of the happy throne
And fall of many kings. But fear not yet
To take upon you what is yours: you may
Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,
And yet seem cold, the time you may so hoodwink.
We have willing dames enough: there cannot be
That vulture in you, to devour so many
As will to greatness dedicate themselves,
Finding it so inclined.

31
	

IV,3,1940
	

This avarice
Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root
Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been
The sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;
Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will.
Of your mere own: all these are portable,
With other graces weigh'd.

32
	

IV,3,1957
	

O Scotland, Scotland!

33
	

IV,3,1960
	

Fit to govern!
No, not to live. O nation miserable,
With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter'd,
When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,
Since that the truest issue of thy throne
By his own interdiction stands accursed,
And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father
Was a most sainted king: the queen that bore thee,
Oftener upon her knees than on her feet,
Died every day she lived. Fare thee well!
These evils thou repeat'st upon thyself
Have banish'd me from Scotland. O my breast,
Thy hope ends here!

34
	

IV,3,1997
	

Such welcome and unwelcome things at once
'Tis hard to reconcile.

35
	

IV,3,2008
	

What's the disease he means?

36
	

IV,3,2024
	

See, who comes here?

37
	

IV,3,2026
	

My ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither.

38
	

IV,3,2030
	

Stands Scotland where it did?

39
	

IV,3,2041
	

O, relation
Too nice, and yet too true!

40
	

IV,3,2046
	

How does my wife?

41
	

IV,3,2048
	

And all my children?

42
	

IV,3,2050
	

The tyrant has not batter'd at their peace?

43
	

IV,3,2052
	

But not a niggard of your speech: how goes't?

44
	

IV,3,2070
	

What concern they?
The general cause? or is it a fee-grief
Due to some single breast?

45
	

IV,3,2076
	

If it be mine,
Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it.

46
	

IV,3,2081
	

Hum! I guess at it.

47
	

IV,3,2090
	

My children too?

48
	

IV,3,2093
	

And I must be from thence!
My wife kill'd too?

49
	

IV,3,2099
	

He has no children. All my pretty ones?
Did you say all? O hell-kite! All?
What, all my pretty chickens and their dam
At one fell swoop?

50
	

IV,3,2104
	

I shall do so;
But I must also feel it as a man:
I cannot but remember such things were,
That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on,
And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,
They were all struck for thee! naught that I am,
Not for their own demerits, but for mine,
Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now!

51
	

IV,3,2114
	

O, I could play the woman with mine eyes
And braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens,
Cut short all intermission; front to front
Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;
Within my sword's length set him; if he 'scape,
Heaven forgive him too!

52
	

V,4,2342
	

Let our just censures
Attend the true event, and put we on
Industrious soldiership.

53
	

V,6,2426
	

Make all our trumpets speak; give them all breath,
Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.

54
	

V,7,2451
	

That way the noise is. Tyrant, show thy face!
If thou be'st slain and with no stroke of mine,
My wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still.
I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms
Are hired to bear their staves: either thou, Macbeth,
Or else my sword with an unbatter'd edge
I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;
By this great clatter, one of greatest note
Seems bruited. Let me find him, fortune!
And more I beg not.

55
	

V,8,2477
	

Turn, hell-hound, turn!

56
	

V,8,2481
	

I have no words:
My voice is in my sword: thou bloodier villain
Than terms can give thee out!

57
	

V,8,2491
	

Despair thy charm;
And let the angel whom thou still hast served
Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother's womb
Untimely ripp'd.

58
	

V,8,2501
	

Then yield thee, coward,
And live to be the show and gaze o' the time:
We'll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,
Painted on a pole, and underwrit,
'Here may you see the tyrant.'

59
	

V,8,2542
	

Hail, king! for so thou art: behold, where stands
The usurper's cursed head: the time is free:
I see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl,
That speak my salutation in their minds;
Whose voices I desire aloud with mine:
Hail, King of Scotland!

Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky
And fan our people cold. Norway himself,
With terrible numbers,
Assisted by that most disloyal traitor
The thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;
Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof,
Confronted him with self-comparisons,
Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm.
Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,
The victory fell on us.

3
	

I,2,86
	

That now
Sweno, the Norways' king, craves composition:
Nor would we deign him burial of his men
Till he disbursed at Saint Colme's inch
Ten thousand dollars to our general use.

4
	

I,2,94
	

I'll see it done.

5
	

I,3,193
	

The king hath happily received, Macbeth,
The news of thy success; and when he reads
Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight,
His wonders and his praises do contend
Which should be thine or his: silenced with that,
In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day,
He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,
Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,
Strange images of death. As thick as hail
Came post with post; and every one did bear
Thy praises in his kingdom's great defence,
And pour'd them down before him.

6
	

I,3,209
	

And, for an earnest of a greater honour,
He bade me, from him, call thee thane of Cawdor:
In which addition, hail, most worthy thane!
For it is thine.

7
	

II,4,952
	

Ah, good father,
Thou seest, the heavens, as troubled with man's act,
Threaten his bloody stage: by the clock, 'tis day,
And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp:
Is't night's predominance, or the day's shame,
That darkness does the face of earth entomb,
When living light should kiss it?

8
	

II,4,963
	

And Duncan's horses—a thing most strange and certain—
Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race,
Turn'd wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out,
Contending 'gainst obedience, as they would make
War with mankind.

9
	

II,4,969
	

They did so, to the amazement of mine eyes
That look'd upon't. Here comes the good Macduff.
[Enter MACDUFF]
How goes the world, sir, now?

10
	

II,4,974
	

Is't known who did this more than bloody deed?

11
	

II,4,976
	

Alas, the day!
What good could they pretend?

12
	

II,4,982
	

'Gainst nature still!
Thriftless ambition, that wilt ravin up
Thine own life's means! Then 'tis most like
The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.

13
	

II,4,988
	

Where is Duncan's body?

14
	

II,4,992
	

Will you to Scone?

15
	

II,4,994
	

Well, I will thither.

16
	

II,4,997
	

Farewell, father.

17
	

III,4,1327
	

His absence, sir,
Lays blame upon his promise. Please't your highness
To grace us with your royal company.

18
	

III,4,1338
	

Gentlemen, rise: his highness is not well.

19
	

III,4,1416
	

What sights, my lord?

20
	

IV,2,1740
	

You must have patience, madam.

21
	

IV,2,1744
	

You know not
Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.

22
	

IV,2,1755
	

My dearest coz,
I pray you, school yourself: but for your husband,
He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows
The fits o' the season. I dare not speak
much further;
But cruel are the times, when we are traitors
And do not know ourselves, when we hold rumour
From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,
But float upon a wild and violent sea
Each way and move. I take my leave of you:
Shall not be long but I'll be here again:
Things at the worst will cease, or else climb upward
To what they were before. My pretty cousin,
Blessing upon you!

23
	

IV,2,1770
	

I am so much a fool, should I stay longer,
It would be my disgrace and your discomfort:
I take my leave at once.

24
	

IV,3,2029
	

Sir, amen.

25
	

IV,3,2031
	

Alas, poor country!
Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot
Be call'd our mother, but our grave; where nothing,
But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;
Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air
Are made, not mark'd; where violent sorrow seems
A modern ecstasy; the dead man's knell
Is there scarce ask'd for who; and good men's lives
Expire before the flowers in their caps,
Dying or ere they sicken.

26
	

IV,3,2044
	

That of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker:
Each minute teems a new one.

27
	

IV,3,2047
	

Why, well.

28
	

IV,3,2049
	

Well too.

29
	

IV,3,2051
	

No; they were well at peace when I did leave 'em.

30
	

IV,3,2053
	

When I came hither to transport the tidings,
Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour
Of many worthy fellows that were out;
Which was to my belief witness'd the rather,
For that I saw the tyrant's power a-foot:
Now is the time of help; your eye in Scotland
Would create soldiers, make our women fight,
To doff their dire distresses.

31
	

IV,3,2066
	

Would I could answer
This comfort with the like! But I have words
That would be howl'd out in the desert air,
Where hearing should not latch them.

32
	

IV,3,2073
	

No mind that's honest
But in it shares some woe; though the main part
Pertains to you alone.

33
	

IV,3,2078
	

Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever,
Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound
That ever yet they heard.

34
	

IV,3,2082
	

Your castle is surprised; your wife and babes
Savagely slaughter'd: to relate the manner,
Were, on the quarry of these murder'd deer,
To add the death of you.

35
	

IV,3,2091
	

Wife, children, servants, all
That could be found.

36
	

IV,3,2095
	

I have said.

37
	

V,8,2521
	

Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt:
He only lived but till he was a man;
The which no sooner had his prowess confirm'd
In the unshrinking station where he fought,
But like a man he died.

38
	

V,8,2527
	

Ay, and brought off the field: your cause of sorrow
Must not be measured by his worth, for then
It hath no end.

39
	

V,8,2531
	

Ay, on the front.
