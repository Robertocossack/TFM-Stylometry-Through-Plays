I,2,208
	

'Tis better as it is.

2
	

I,2,221
	

Let him do his spite:
My services which I have done the signiory
Shall out-tongue his complaints. 'Tis yet to know,—
Which, when I know that boasting is an honour,
I shall promulgate—I fetch my life and being
From men of royal siege, and my demerits
May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune
As this that I have reach'd: for know, Iago,
But that I love the gentle Desdemona,
I would not my unhoused free condition
Put into circumscription and confine
For the sea's worth. But, look! what lights come yond?

3
	

I,2,235
	

Not I. I must be found:
My parts, my title and my perfect soul
Shall manifest me rightly. Is it they?

4
	

I,2,240
	

The servants of the duke, and my lieutenant.
The goodness of the night upon you, friends!
What is the news?

5
	

I,2,246
	

What is the matter, think you?

6
	

I,2,257
	

'Tis well I am found by you.
I will but spend a word here in the house,
And go with you.

7
	

I,2,269
	

Have with you.

8
	

I,2,274
	

Holla! stand there!

9
	

I,2,279
	

Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them.
Good signior, you shall more command with years
Than with your weapons.

10
	

I,2,302
	

Hold your hands,
Both you of my inclining, and the rest:
Were it my cue to fight, I should have known it
Without a prompter. Where will you that I go
To answer this your charge?

11
	

I,2,310
	

What if I do obey?
How may the duke be therewith satisfied,
Whose messengers are here about my side,
Upon some present business of the state
To bring me to him?

12
	

I,3,416
	

Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,
My very noble and approved good masters,
That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,
It is most true; true, I have married her:
The very head and front of my offending
Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,
And little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace:
For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,
Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used
Their dearest action in the tented field,
And little of this great world can I speak,
More than pertains to feats of broil and battle,
And therefore little shall I grace my cause
In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,
I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver
Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,
What conjuration and what mighty magic,
For such proceeding I am charged withal,
I won his daughter.

13
	

I,3,457
	

I do beseech you,
Send for the lady to the Sagittary,
And let her speak of me before her father:
If you do find me foul in her report,
The trust, the office I do hold of you,
Not only take away, but let your sentence
Even fall upon my life.

14
	

I,3,465
	

Ancient, conduct them: you best know the place.
[Exeunt IAGO and Attendants]
And, till she come, as truly as to heaven
I do confess the vices of my blood,
So justly to your grave ears I'll present
How I did thrive in this fair lady's love,
And she in mine.

15
	

I,3,473
	

Her father loved me; oft invited me;
Still question'd me the story of my life,
From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes,
That I have passed.
I ran it through, even from my boyish days,
To the very moment that he bade me tell it;
Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,
Of moving accidents by flood and field
Of hair-breadth scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,
Of being taken by the insolent foe
And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence
And portance in my travels' history:
Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,
Rough quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven
It was my hint to speak,—such was the process;
And of the Cannibals that each other eat,
The Anthropophagi and men whose heads
Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear
Would Desdemona seriously incline:
But still the house-affairs would draw her thence:
Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,
She'ld come again, and with a greedy ear
Devour up my discourse: which I observing,
Took once a pliant hour, and found good means
To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart
That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,
Whereof by parcels she had something heard,
But not intentively: I did consent,
And often did beguile her of her tears,
When I did speak of some distressful stroke
That my youth suffer'd. My story being done,
She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:
She swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange,
'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful:
She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd
That heaven had made her such a man: she thank'd me,
And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,
I should but teach him how to tell my story.
And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:
She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,
And I loved her that she did pity them.
This only is the witchcraft I have used:
Here comes the lady; let her witness it.

16
	

I,3,578
	

The tyrant custom, most grave senators,
Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war
My thrice-driven bed of down: I do agnise
A natural and prompt alacrity
I find in hardness, and do undertake
These present wars against the Ottomites.
Most humbly therefore bending to your state,
I crave fit disposition for my wife.
Due reference of place and exhibition,
With such accommodation and besort
As levels with her breeding.

17
	

I,3,592
	

Nor I.

18
	

I,3,612
	

Let her have your voices.
Vouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not,
To please the palate of my appetite,
Nor to comply with heat—the young affects
In me defunct—and proper satisfaction.
But to be free and bounteous to her mind:
And heaven defend your good souls, that you think
I will your serious and great business scant
For she is with me: no, when light-wing'd toys
Of feather'd Cupid seal with wanton dullness
My speculative and officed instruments,
That my disports corrupt and taint my business,
Let housewives make a skillet of my helm,
And all indign and base adversities
Make head against my estimation!

19
	

I,3,631
	

With all my heart.

20
	

I,3,637
	

So please your grace, my ancient;
A man he is of honest and trust:
To his conveyance I assign my wife,
With what else needful your good grace shall think
To be sent after me.

21
	

I,3,652
	

My life upon her faith! Honest Iago,
My Desdemona must I leave to thee:
I prithee, let thy wife attend on her:
And bring them after in the best advantage.
Come, Desdemona: I have but an hour
Of love, of worldly matters and direction,
To spend with thee: we must obey the time.

22
	

II,1,972
	

O my fair warrior!

23
	

II,1,974
	

It gives me wonder great as my content
To see you here before me. O my soul's joy!
If after every tempest come such calms,
May the winds blow till they have waken'd death!
And let the labouring bark climb hills of seas
Olympus-high and duck again as low
As hell's from heaven! If it were now to die,
'Twere now to be most happy; for, I fear,
My soul hath her content so absolute
That not another comfort like to this
Succeeds in unknown fate.

24
	

II,1,988
	

Amen to that, sweet powers!
I cannot speak enough of this content;
It stops me here; it is too much of joy:
And this, and this, the greatest discords be
[Kissing her]
That e'er our hearts shall make!

25
	

II,1,997
	

Come, let us to the castle.
News, friends; our wars are done, the Turks
are drown'd.
How does my old acquaintance of this isle?
Honey, you shall be well desired in Cyprus;
I have found great love amongst them. O my sweet,
I prattle out of fashion, and I dote
In mine own comforts. I prithee, good Iago,
Go to the bay and disembark my coffers:
Bring thou the master to the citadel;
He is a good one, and his worthiness
Does challenge much respect. Come, Desdemona,
Once more, well met at Cyprus.

26
	

II,3,1130
	

Good Michael, look you to the guard to-night:
Let's teach ourselves that honourable stop,
Not to outsport discretion.

27
	

II,3,1136
	

Iago is most honest.
Michael, good night: to-morrow with your earliest
Let me have speech with you.
[To DESDEMONA]
Come, my dear love,
The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue;
That profit's yet to come 'tween me and you.
Good night.

28
	

II,3,1308
	

What is the matter here?

29
	

II,3,1311
	

Hold, for your lives!

30
	

II,3,1315
	

Why, how now, ho! from whence ariseth this?
Are we turn'd Turks, and to ourselves do that
Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?
For Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl:
He that stirs next to carve for his own rage
Holds his soul light; he dies upon his motion.
Silence that dreadful bell: it frights the isle
From her propriety. What is the matter, masters?
Honest Iago, that look'st dead with grieving,
Speak, who began this? on thy love, I charge thee.

31
	

II,3,1334
	

How comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?

32
	

II,3,1336
	

Worthy Montano, you were wont be civil;
The gravity and stillness of your youth
The world hath noted, and your name is great
In mouths of wisest censure: what's the matter,
That you unlace your reputation thus
And spend your rich opinion for the name
Of a night-brawler? give me answer to it.

33
	

II,3,1352
	

Now, by heaven,
My blood begins my safer guides to rule;
And passion, having my best judgment collied,
Assays to lead the way: if I once stir,
Or do but lift this arm, the best of you
Shall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know
How this foul rout began, who set it on;
And he that is approved in this offence,
Though he had twinn'd with me, both at a birth,
Shall lose me. What! in a town of war,
Yet wild, the people's hearts brimful of fear,
To manage private and domestic quarrel,
In night, and on the court and guard of safety!
'Tis monstrous. Iago, who began't?

34
	

II,3,1396
	

I know, Iago,
Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter,
Making it light to Cassio. Cassio, I love thee
But never more be officer of mine.
[Re-enter DESDEMONA, attended]
Look, if my gentle love be not raised up!
I'll make thee an example.

35
	

II,3,1404
	

All's well now, sweeting; come away to bed.
Sir, for your hurts, myself will be your surgeon:
Lead him off.
[To MONTANO, who is led off]
Iago, look with care about the town,
And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted.
Come, Desdemona: 'tis the soldiers' life
To have their balmy slumbers waked with strife.

36
	

III,2,1617
	

These letters give, Iago, to the pilot;
And by him do my duties to the senate:
That done, I will be walking on the works;
Repair there to me.

37
	

III,2,1622
	

This fortification, gentlemen, shall we see't?

38
	

III,3,1665
	

What dost thou say?

39
	

III,3,1667
	

Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?

40
	

III,3,1671
	

I do believe 'twas he.

41
	

III,3,1675
	

Who is't you mean?

42
	

III,3,1683
	

Went he hence now?

43
	

III,3,1687
	

Not now, sweet Desdemona; some other time.

44
	

III,3,1689
	

The sooner, sweet, for you.

45
	

III,3,1691
	

No, not to-night.

46
	

III,3,1693
	

I shall not dine at home;
I meet the captains at the citadel.

47
	

III,3,1710
	

Prithee, no more: let him come when he will;
I will deny thee nothing.

48
	

III,3,1720
	

I will deny thee nothing:
Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,
To leave me but a little to myself.

49
	

III,3,1724
	

Farewell, my Desdemona: I'll come to thee straight.

50
	

III,3,1728
	

Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
But I do love thee! and when I love thee not,
Chaos is come again.

51
	

III,3,1732
	

What dost thou say, Iago?

52
	

III,3,1735
	

He did, from first to last: why dost thou ask?

53
	

III,3,1738
	

Why of thy thought, Iago?

54
	

III,3,1740
	

O, yes; and went between us very oft.

55
	

III,3,1742
	

Indeed! ay, indeed: discern'st thou aught in that?
Is he not honest?

56
	

III,3,1745
	

Honest! ay, honest.

57
	

III,3,1747
	

What dost thou think?

58
	

III,3,1749
	

Think, my lord!
By heaven, he echoes me,
As if there were some monster in his thought
Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something:
I heard thee say even now, thou likedst not that,
When Cassio left my wife: what didst not like?
And when I told thee he was of my counsel
In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst 'Indeed!'
And didst contract and purse thy brow together,
As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain
Some horrible conceit: if thou dost love me,
Show me thy thought.

59
	

III,3,1762
	

I think thou dost;
And, for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty,
And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath,
Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more:
For such things in a false disloyal knave
Are tricks of custom, but in a man that's just
They are close delations, working from the heart
That passion cannot rule.

60
	

III,3,1772
	

I think so too.

61
	

III,3,1775
	

Certain, men should be what they seem.

62
	

III,3,1777
	

Nay, yet there's more in this:
I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,
As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts
The worst of words.

63
	

III,3,1790
	

Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,
If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear
A stranger to thy thoughts.

64
	

III,3,1804
	

What dost thou mean?

65
	

III,3,1812
	

By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts.

66
	

III,3,1815
	

Ha!

67
	

III,3,1822
	

O misery!

68
	

III,3,1828
	

Why, why is this?
Think'st thou I'ld make a lie of jealousy,
To follow still the changes of the moon
With fresh suspicions? No; to be once in doubt
Is once to be resolved: exchange me for a goat,
When I shall turn the business of my soul
To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,
Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me jealous
To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,
Is free of speech, sings, plays and dances well;
Where virtue is, these are more virtuous:
Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw
The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt;
For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago;
I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;
And on the proof, there is no more but this,—
Away at once with love or jealousy!

69
	

III,3,1857
	

Dost thou say so?

70
	

III,3,1861
	

And so she did.

71
	

III,3,1868
	

I am bound to thee for ever.

72
	

III,3,1870
	

Not a jot, not a jot.

73
	

III,3,1877
	

I will not.

74
	

III,3,1882
	

No, not much moved:
I do not think but Desdemona's honest.

75
	

III,3,1885
	

And yet, how nature erring from itself,—

76
	

III,3,1897
	

Farewell, farewell:
If more thou dost perceive, let me know more;
Set on thy wife to observe: leave me, Iago:

77
	

III,3,1901
	

Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless
Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.

78
	

III,3,1916
	

Fear not my government.

79
	

III,3,1919
	

This fellow's of exceeding honesty,
And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,
Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,
Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,
I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind,
To pray at fortune. Haply, for I am black
And have not those soft parts of conversation
That chamberers have, or for I am declined
Into the vale of years,—yet that's not much—
She's gone. I am abused; and my relief
Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,
That we can call these delicate creatures ours,
And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,
And live upon the vapour of a dungeon,
Than keep a corner in the thing I love
For others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones;
Prerogatived are they less than the base;
'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death:
Even then this forked plague is fated to us
When we do quicken. Desdemona comes:
[Re-enter DESDEMONA and EMILIA]
If she be false, O, then heaven mocks itself!
I'll not believe't.

80
	

III,3,1945
	

I am to blame.

81
	

III,3,1948
	

I have a pain upon my forehead here.

82
	

III,3,1952
	

Your napkin is too little:
[He puts the handkerchief from him; and it drops]
Let it alone. Come, I'll go in with you.

83
	

III,3,2009
	

Ha! ha! false to me?

84
	

III,3,2011
	

Avaunt! be gone! thou hast set me on the rack:
I swear 'tis better to be much abused
Than but to know't a little.

85
	

III,3,2015
	

What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust?
I saw't not, thought it not, it harm'd not me:
I slept the next night well, was free and merry;
I found not Cassio's kisses on her lips:
He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stol'n,
Let him not know't, and he's not robb'd at all.

86
	

III,3,2022
	

I had been happy, if the general camp,
Pioners and all, had tasted her sweet body,
So I had nothing known. O, now, for ever
Farewell the tranquil mind! farewell content!
Farewell the plumed troop, and the big wars,
That make ambition virtue! O, farewell!
Farewell the neighing steed, and the shrill trump,
The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife,
The royal banner, and all quality,
Pride, pomp and circumstance of glorious war!
And, O you mortal engines, whose rude throats
The immortal Jove's dead clamours counterfeit,
Farewell! Othello's occupation's gone!

87
	

III,3,2036
	

Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore,
Be sure of it; give me the ocular proof:
Or by the worth of man's eternal soul,
Thou hadst been better have been born a dog
Than answer my waked wrath!

88
	

III,3,2042
	

Make me to see't; or, at the least, so prove it,
That the probation bear no hinge nor loop
To hang a doubt on; or woe upon thy life!

89
	

III,3,2046
	

If thou dost slander her and torture me,
Never pray more; abandon all remorse;
On horror's head horrors accumulate;
Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amazed;
For nothing canst thou to damnation add
Greater than that.

90
	

III,3,2060
	

Nay, stay: thou shouldst be honest.

91
	

III,3,2063
	

By the world,
I think my wife be honest and think she is not;
I think that thou art just and think thou art not.
I'll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh
As Dian's visage, is now begrimed and black
As mine own face. If there be cords, or knives,
Poison, or fire, or suffocating streams,
I'll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!

92
	

III,3,2074
	

Would! nay, I will.

93
	

III,3,2078
	

Death and damnation! O!

94
	

III,3,2091
	

Give me a living reason she's disloyal.

95
	

III,3,2109
	

O monstrous! monstrous!

96
	

III,3,2111
	

But this denoted a foregone conclusion:
'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.

97
	

III,3,2115
	

I'll tear her all to pieces.

98
	

III,3,2120
	

I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.

99
	

III,3,2124
	

If it be that—

100
	

III,3,2127
	

O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!
One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.
Now do I see 'tis true. Look here, Iago;
All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.
'Tis gone.
Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow cell!
Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne
To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,
For 'tis of aspics' tongues!

101
	

III,3,2137
	

O, blood, blood, blood!

102
	

III,3,2139
	

Never, Iago: Like to the Pontic sea,
Whose icy current and compulsive course
Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on
To the Propontic and the Hellespont,
Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,
Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love,
Till that a capable and wide revenge
Swallow them up. Now, by yond marble heaven,
[Kneels]
In the due reverence of a sacred vow
I here engage my words.

103
	

III,3,2160
	

I greet thy love,
Not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,
And will upon the instant put thee to't:
Within these three days let me hear thee say
That Cassio's not alive.

104
	

III,3,2167
	

Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her!
Come, go with me apart; I will withdraw,
To furnish me with some swift means of death
For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.

105
	

III,4,2208
	

Well, my good lady.
[Aside]
O, hardness to dissemble!—
How do you, Desdemona?

106
	

III,4,2213
	

Give me your hand: this hand is moist, my lady.

107
	

III,4,2215
	

This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart:
Hot, hot, and moist: this hand of yours requires
A sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer,
Much castigation, exercise devout;
For here's a young and sweating devil here,
That commonly rebels. 'Tis a good hand,
A frank one.

108
	

III,4,2224
	

A liberal hand: the hearts of old gave hands;
But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.

109
	

III,4,2227
	

What promise, chuck?

110
	

III,4,2229
	

I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me;
Lend me thy handkerchief.

111
	

III,4,2232
	

That which I gave you.

112
	

III,4,2234
	

Not?

113
	

III,4,2236
	

That is a fault.
That handkerchief
Did an Egyptian to my mother give;
She was a charmer, and could almost read
The thoughts of people: she told her, while
she kept it,
'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father
Entirely to her love, but if she lost it
Or made gift of it, my father's eye
Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt
After new fancies: she, dying, gave it me;
And bid me, when my fate would have me wive,
To give it her. I did so: and take heed on't;
Make it a darling like your precious eye;
To lose't or give't away were such perdition
As nothing else could match.

114
	

III,4,2253
	

'Tis true: there's magic in the web of it:
A sibyl, that had number'd in the world
The sun to course two hundred compasses,
In her prophetic fury sew'd the work;
The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk;
And it was dyed in mummy which the skilful
Conserved of maidens' hearts.

115
	

III,4,2261
	

Most veritable; therefore look to't well.

116
	

III,4,2263
	

Ha! wherefore?

117
	

III,4,2265
	

Is't lost? is't gone? speak, is it out
o' the way?

118
	

III,4,2268
	

Say you?

119
	

III,4,2270
	

How!

120
	

III,4,2272
	

Fetch't, let me see't.

121
	

III,4,2276
	

Fetch me the handkerchief: my mind misgives.

122
	

III,4,2279
	

The handkerchief!

123
	

III,4,2281
	

The handkerchief!

124
	

III,4,2285
	

The handkerchief!

125
	

III,4,2287
	

Away!

126
	

IV,1,2410
	

Think so, Iago!

127
	

IV,1,2413
	

An unauthorized kiss.

128
	

IV,1,2416
	

Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!
It is hypocrisy against the devil:
They that mean virtuously, and yet do so,
The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven.

129
	

IV,1,2422
	

What then?

130
	

IV,1,2425
	

She is protectress of her honour too:
May she give that?

131
	

IV,1,2430
	

By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.
Thou said'st, it comes o'er my memory,
As doth the raven o'er the infected house,
Boding to all—he had my handkerchief.

132
	

IV,1,2435
	

That's not so good now.

133
	

IV,1,2443
	

Hath he said any thing?

134
	

IV,1,2446
	

What hath he said?

135
	

IV,1,2448
	

What? what?

136
	

IV,1,2450
	

With her?

137
	

IV,1,2452
	

Lie with her! lie on her! We say lie on her, when
they belie her. Lie with her! that's fulsome.
—Handkerchief—confessions—handkerchief!—To
confess, and be hanged for his labour;—first, to be
hanged, and then to confess.—I tremble at it.
Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing
passion without some instruction. It is not words
that shake me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips.
—Is't possible?—Confess—handkerchief!—O devil!—

138
	

IV,1,2482
	

Dost thou mock me?

139
	

IV,1,2485
	

A horned man's a monster and a beast.

140
	

IV,1,2488
	

Did he confess it?

141
	

IV,1,2498
	

O, thou art wise; 'tis certain.

142
	

IV,1,2515
	

Dost thou hear, Iago?
I will be found most cunning in my patience;
But—dost thou hear?—most bloody.

143
	

IV,1,2540
	

Look, how he laughs already!

144
	

IV,1,2543
	

Now he denies it faintly, and laughs it out.

145
	

IV,1,2545
	

Now he importunes him
To tell it o'er: go to; well said, well said.

146
	

IV,1,2550
	

Do you triumph, Roman? do you triumph?

147
	

IV,1,2554
	

So, so, so, so: they laugh that win.

148
	

IV,1,2558
	

Have you scored me? Well.

149
	

IV,1,2562
	

Iago beckons me; now he begins the story.

150
	

IV,1,2567
	

Crying 'O dear Cassio!' as it were: his gesture
imports it.

151
	

IV,1,2571
	

Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O,
I see that nose of yours, but not that dog I shall
throw it to.

152
	

IV,1,2588
	

By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!

153
	

IV,1,2601
	

[Advancing] How shall I murder him, Iago?

154
	

IV,1,2603
	

O Iago!

155
	

IV,1,2605
	

Was that mine?

156
	

IV,1,2609
	

I would have him nine years a-killing.
A fine woman! a fair woman! a sweet woman!

157
	

IV,1,2612
	

Ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damned to-night;
for she shall not live: no, my heart is turned to
stone; I strike it, and it hurts my hand. O, the
world hath not a sweeter creature: she might lie by
an emperor's side and command him tasks.

158
	

IV,1,2618
	

Hang her! I do but say what she is: so delicate
with her needle: an admirable musician: O! she
will sing the savageness out of a bear: of so high
and plenteous wit and invention:—

159
	

IV,1,2623
	

O, a thousand thousand times: and then, of so
gentle a condition!

160
	

IV,1,2626
	

Nay, that's certain: but yet the pity of it, Iago!
O Iago, the pity of it, Iago!

161
	

IV,1,2631
	

I will chop her into messes: cuckold me!

162
	

IV,1,2633
	

With mine officer!

163
	

IV,1,2635
	

Get me some poison, Iago; this night: I'll not
expostulate with her, lest her body and beauty
unprovide my mind again: this night, Iago.

164
	

IV,1,2640
	

Good, good: the justice of it pleases: very good.

165
	

IV,1,2643
	

Excellent good.
[A trumpet within]
What trumpet is that same?

166
	

IV,1,2650
	

With all my heart, sir.

167
	

IV,1,2653
	

I kiss the instrument of their pleasures.

168
	

IV,1,2662
	

Are you sure of that?

169
	

IV,1,2664
	

[Reads] 'This fail you not to do, as you will—'

170
	

IV,1,2669
	

Fire and brimstone!

171
	

IV,1,2671
	

Are you wise?

172
	

IV,1,2677
	

Indeed!

173
	

IV,1,2679
	

I am glad to see you mad.

174
	

IV,1,2681
	

[Striking her] Devil!

175
	

IV,1,2686
	

O devil, devil!
If that the earth could teem with woman's tears,
Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile.
Out of my sight!

176
	

IV,1,2694
	

Mistress!

177
	

IV,1,2696
	

What would you with her, sir?

178
	

IV,1,2698
	

Ay; you did wish that I would make her turn:
Sir, she can turn, and turn, and yet go on,
And turn again; and she can weep, sir, weep;
And she's obedient, as you say, obedient,
Very obedient. Proceed you in your tears.
Concerning this, sir,—O well-painted passion!—
I am commanded home. Get you away;
I'll send for you anon. Sir, I obey the mandate,
And will return to Venice. Hence, avaunt!
[Exit DESDEMONA]
Cassio shall have my place. And, sir, tonight,
I do entreat that we may sup together:
You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus.—Goats and monkeys!

179
	

IV,2,2737
	

You have seen nothing then?

180
	

IV,2,2739
	

Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together.

181
	

IV,2,2742
	

What, did they never whisper?

182
	

IV,2,2744
	

Nor send you out o' the way?

183
	

IV,2,2746
	

To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?

184
	

IV,2,2748
	

That's strange.

185
	

IV,2,2757
	

Bid her come hither: go.
[Exit EMILIA]
She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd
That cannot say as much. This is a subtle whore,
A closet lock and key of villanous secrets
And yet she'll kneel and pray; I have seen her do't.

186
	

IV,2,2765
	

Pray, chuck, come hither.

187
	

IV,2,2767
	

Let me see your eyes;
Look in my face.

188
	

IV,2,2770
	

[To EMILIA] Some of your function, mistress;
Leave procreants alone and shut the door;
Cough, or cry 'hem,' if any body come:
Your mystery, your mystery: nay, dispatch.

189
	

IV,2,2778
	

Why, what art thou?

190
	

IV,2,2781
	

Come, swear it, damn thyself
Lest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves
Should fear to seize thee: therefore be double damn'd:
Swear thou art honest.

191
	

IV,2,2786
	

Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.

192
	

IV,2,2788
	

O Desdemona! away! away! away!

193
	

IV,2,2795
	

Had it pleased heaven
To try me with affliction; had they rain'd
All kinds of sores and shames on my bare head.
Steep'd me in poverty to the very lips,
Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes,
I should have found in some place of my soul
A drop of patience: but, alas, to make me
A fixed figure for the time of scorn
To point his slow unmoving finger at!
Yet could I bear that too; well, very well:
But there, where I have garner'd up my heart,
Where either I must live, or bear no life;
The fountain from the which my current runs,
Or else dries up; to be discarded thence!
Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads
To knot and gender in! Turn thy complexion there,
Patience, thou young and rose-lipp'd cherubin,—
Ay, there, look grim as hell!

194
	

IV,2,2814
	

O, ay; as summer flies are in the shambles,
That quicken even with blowing. O thou weed,
Who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet
That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst
ne'er been born!

195
	

IV,2,2820
	

Was this fair paper, this most goodly book,
Made to write 'whore' upon? What committed!
Committed! O thou public commoner!
I should make very forges of my cheeks,
That would to cinders burn up modesty,
Did I but speak thy deeds. What committed!
Heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks,
The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets
Is hush'd within the hollow mine of earth,
And will not hear it. What committed!
Impudent strumpet!

196
	

IV,2,2832
	

Are you not a strumpet?

197
	

IV,2,2837
	

What, not a whore?

198
	

IV,2,2839
	

Is't possible?

199
	

IV,2,2841
	

I cry you mercy, then:
I took you for that cunning whore of Venice
That married with Othello.
[Raising his voice]
You, mistress,
That have the office opposite to Saint Peter,
And keep the gate of hell!
[Re-enter EMILIA]
You, you, ay, you!
We have done our course; there's money for your pains:
I pray you, turn the key and keep our counsel.

200
	

IV,3,3020
	

O, pardon me: 'twill do me good to walk.

201
	

IV,3,3023
	

Will you walk, sir?
O,—Desdemona,—

202
	

IV,3,3026
	

Get you to bed on the instant; I will be returned
forthwith: dismiss your attendant there: look it be done.

203
	

V,1,3171
	

The voice of Cassio: Iago keeps his word.

204
	

V,1,3173
	

It is even so.

205
	

V,1,3175
	

'Tis he:—O brave Iago, honest and just,
That hast such noble sense of thy friend's wrong!
Thou teachest me. Minion, your dear lies dead,
And your unblest fate hies: strumpet, I come.
Forth of my heart those charms, thine eyes, are blotted;
Thy bed, lust-stain'd, shall with lust's blood be spotted.

206
	

V,2,3302
	

It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul,—
Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars!—
It is the cause. Yet I'll not shed her blood;
Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow,
And smooth as monumental alabaster.
Yet she must die, else she'll betray more men.
Put out the light, and then put out the light:
If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,
I can again thy former light restore,
Should I repent me: but once put out thy light,
Thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature,
I know not where is that Promethean heat
That can thy light relume. When I have pluck'd the rose,
I cannot give it vital growth again.
It must needs wither: I'll smell it on the tree.
[Kissing her]
Ah balmy breath, that dost almost persuade
Justice to break her sword! One more, one more.
Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee,
And love thee after. One more, and this the last:
So sweet was ne'er so fatal. I must weep,
But they are cruel tears: this sorrow's heavenly;
It strikes where it doth love. She wakes.

207
	

V,2,3326
	

Ay. Desdemona.

208
	

V,2,3328
	

Have you pray'd to-night, Desdemona?

209
	

V,2,3330
	

If you bethink yourself of any crime
Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace,
Solicit for it straight.

210
	

V,2,3334
	

Well, do it, and be brief; I will walk by:
I would not kill thy unprepared spirit;
No; heaven forfend! I would not kill thy soul.

211
	

V,2,3338
	

Ay, I do.

212
	

V,2,3341
	

Amen, with all my heart!

213
	

V,2,3343
	

Hum!

214
	

V,2,3347
	

Think on thy sins.

215
	

V,2,3349
	

Ay, and for that thou diest.

216
	

V,2,3355
	

Peace, and be still!

217
	

V,2,3357
	

That handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee
Thou gavest to Cassio.

218
	

V,2,3361
	

Sweet soul, take heed,
Take heed of perjury; thou art on thy deathbed.

219
	

V,2,3364
	

Yes, presently:
Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin;
For to deny each article with oath
Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception
That I do groan withal. Thou art to die.

220
	

V,2,3370
	

I say, amen.

221
	

V,2,3375
	

By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in's hand.
O perjured woman! thou dost stone my heart,
And makest me call what I intend to do
A murder, which I thought a sacrifice:
I saw the handkerchief.

222
	

V,2,3383
	

He hath confess'd.

223
	

V,2,3385
	

That he hath used thee.

224
	

V,2,3387
	

Ay.

225
	

V,2,3389
	

No, his mouth is stopp'd;
Honest Iago hath ta'en order for't.

226
	

V,2,3392
	

Had all his hairs been lives, my great revenge
Had stomach for them all.

227
	

V,2,3395
	

Out, strumpet! weep'st thou for him to my face?

228
	

V,2,3397
	

Down, strumpet!

229
	

V,2,3399
	

Nay, if you strive—

230
	

V,2,3401
	

Being done, there is no pause.

231
	

V,2,3403
	

It is too late.

232
	

V,2,3406
	

What noise is this? Not dead? not yet quite dead?
I that am cruel am yet merciful;
I would not have thee linger in thy pain: So, so.

233
	

V,2,3410
	

Who's there?

234
	

V,2,3412
	

Yes: 'tis Emilia. By and by. She's dead.
'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death.—
The noise was here. Ha! no more moving?
Still as the grave. Shall she come in? were't good?—
I think she stirs again:—no. What's best to do?
If she come in, she'll sure speak to my wife:
My wife! my wife! what wife? I have no wife.
O insupportable! O heavy hour!
Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse
Of sun and moon, and that the affrighted globe
Should yawn at alteration.

235
	

V,2,3425
	

I had forgot thee: O, come in, Emilia;
Soft; by and by. Let me the curtains draw.
Where art thou?
[Unlocks the door]
[Enter EMILIA]
What's the matter with thee now?

236
	

V,2,3432
	

What, now?

237
	

V,2,3434
	

It is the very error of the moon;
She comes more nearer earth than she was wont,
And makes men mad.

238
	

V,2,3439
	

Roderigo kill'd!
And Cassio kill'd!

239
	

V,2,3442
	

Not Cassio kill'd! then murder's out of tune,
And sweet revenge grows harsh.

240
	

V,2,3446
	

That! what?

241
	

V,2,3455
	

Why, how should she be murder'd?

242
	

V,2,3457
	

You heard her say herself, it was not I.

243
	

V,2,3459
	

She's, like a liar, gone to burning hell:
'Twas I that kill'd her.

244
	

V,2,3463
	

She turn'd to folly, and she was a whore.

245
	

V,2,3465
	

She was false as water.

246
	

V,2,3468
	

Cassio did top her; ask thy husband else.
O, I were damn'd beneath all depth in hell,
But that I did proceed upon just grounds
To this extremity. Thy husband knew it all.

247
	

V,2,3473
	

Thy husband.

248
	

V,2,3475
	

Ay, with Cassio. Nay, had she been true,
If heaven would make me such another world
Of one entire and Perfect chrysolite,
I'ld not have sold her for it.

249
	

V,2,3480
	

Ay, 'twas he that told me first:
An honest man he is, and hates the slime
That sticks on filthy deeds.

250
	

V,2,3484
	

What needs this iteration, woman? I say thy husband.

251
	

V,2,3487
	

He, woman;
I say thy husband: dost understand the word?
My friend, thy husband, honest, honest Iago.

252
	

V,2,3493
	

Ha!

253
	

V,2,3497
	

Peace, you were best.

254
	

V,2,3525
	

Nay, stare not, masters: it is true, indeed.

255
	

V,2,3536
	

O! O! O!

256
	

V,2,3541
	

[Rising] O, she was foul!
I scarce did know you, uncle: there lies your niece,
Whose breath, indeed, these hands have newly stopp'd:
I know this act shows horrible and grim.

257
	

V,2,3551
	

'Tis pitiful; but yet Iago knows
That she with Cassio hath the act of shame
A thousand times committed; Cassio confess'd it:
And she did gratify his amorous works
With that recognizance and pledge of love
Which I first gave her; I saw it in his hand:
It was a handkerchief, an antique token
My father gave my mother.

258
	

V,2,3582
	

Are there no stones in heaven
But what serve for the thunder?—Precious villain!

259
	

V,2,3594
	

I am not valiant neither,
But ever puny whipster gets my sword:
But why should honour outlive honesty?
Let it go all.

260
	

V,2,3607
	

I have another weapon in this chamber;
It is a sword of Spain, the ice-brook's temper:—
O, here it is. Uncle, I must come forth.

261
	

V,2,3612
	

Look in upon me then and speak with me,
Or, naked as I am, I will assault thee.

262
	

V,2,3616
	

Behold, I have a weapon;
A better never did itself sustain
Upon a soldier's thigh: I have seen the day,
That, with this little arm and this good sword,
I have made my way through more impediments
Than twenty times your stop: but, O vain boast!
Who can control his fate? 'tis not so now.
Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon'd;
Here is my journey's end, here is my butt,
And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.
Do you go back dismay'd? 'tis a lost fear;
Man but a rush against Othello's breast,
And he retires. Where should Othello go?
Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr'd wench!
Pale as thy smock! when we shall meet at compt,
This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,
And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl!
Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
Whip me, ye devils,
From the possession of this heavenly sight!
Blow me about in winds! roast me in sulphur!
Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!
O Desdemona! Desdemona! dead!
Oh! Oh! Oh!
[Enter LODOVICO. MONTANO, CASSIO carried in a chair,]
and Officers with IAGO, prisoner]

263
	

V,2,3643
	

That's he that was Othello: here I am.

264
	

V,2,3645
	

I look down towards his feet; but that's a fable.
If that thou best a devil, I cannot kill thee.

265
	

V,2,3650
	

I am not sorry neither: I'ld have thee live;
For, in my sense, 'tis happiness to die.

266
	

V,2,3655
	

Why, any thing:
An honourable murderer, if you will;
For nought I did in hate, but all in honour.

267
	

V,2,3660
	

Ay.

268
	

V,2,3662
	

I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.
Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil
Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?

269
	

V,2,3669
	

Well, thou dost best.

270
	

V,2,3676
	

O villain!

271
	

V,2,3683
	

O the pernicious caitiff!
How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief
That was my wife's?

272
	

V,2,3690
	

O fool! fool! fool!

273
	

V,2,3705
	

Soft you; a word or two before you go.
I have done the state some service, and they know't.
No more of that. I pray you, in your letters,
When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,
Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate,
Nor set down aught in malice: then must you speak
Of one that loved not wisely but too well;
Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought
Perplex'd in the extreme; of one whose hand,
Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away
Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes,
Albeit unused to the melting mood,
Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees
Their medicinal gum. Set you down this;
And say besides, that in Aleppo once,
Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk
Beat a Venetian and traduced the state,
I took by the throat the circumcised dog,
And smote him, thus.

274
	

V,2,3727
	

I kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee: no way but this;

1
	

I,1,2
	

Tush! never tell me; I take it much unkindly
That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse
As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.

2
	

I,1,7
	

Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.

3
	

I,1,34
	

By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.

4
	

I,1,41
	

I would not follow him then.

5
	

I,1,68
	

What a full fortune does the thicklips owe
If he can carry't thus!

6
	

I,1,77
	

Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.

7
	

I,1,81
	

What, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!

8
	

I,1,88
	

Signior, is all your family within?

9
	

I,1,100
	

Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?

10
	

I,1,102
	

My name is Roderigo.

11
	

I,1,110
	

Sir, sir, sir,—

12
	

I,1,114
	

Patience, good sir.

13
	

I,1,117
	

Most grave Brabantio,
In simple and pure soul I come to you.

14
	

I,1,131
	

Sir, I will answer any thing. But, I beseech you,
If't be your pleasure and most wise consent,
As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter,
At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night,
Transported, with no worse nor better guard
But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,
To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor—
If this be known to you and your allowance,
We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;
But if you know not this, my manners tell me
We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe
That, from the sense of all civility,
I thus would play and trifle with your reverence:
Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,
I say again, hath made a gross revolt;
Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes
In an extravagant and wheeling stranger
Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself:
If she be in her chamber or your house,
Let loose on me the justice of the state
For thus deluding you.

15
	

I,1,184
	

Truly, I think they are.

16
	

I,1,191
	

Yes, sir, I have indeed.

17
	

I,1,195
	

I think I can discover him, if you please,
To get good guard and go along with me.

18
	

I,2,275
	

Signior, it is the Moor.

19
	

I,3,660
	

Iago,—

20
	

I,3,662
	

What will I do, thinkest thou?

21
	

I,3,664
	

I will incontinently drown myself.

22
	

I,3,667
	

It is silliness to live when to live is torment; and
then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician.

23
	

I,3,675
	

What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so
fond; but it is not in my virtue to amend it.

24
	

I,3,692
	

It cannot be.

25
	

I,3,721
	

Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on
the issue?

26
	

I,3,732
	

Where shall we meet i' the morning?

27
	

I,3,734
	

I'll be with thee betimes.

28
	

I,3,736
	

What say you?

29
	

I,3,738
	

I am changed: I'll go sell all my land.

30
	

II,1,1018
	

With him! why, 'tis not possible.

31
	

II,1,1049
	

I cannot believe that in her; she's full of
most blessed condition.

32
	

II,1,1056
	

Yes, that I did; but that was but courtesy.

33
	

II,1,1071
	

Well.

34
	

II,1,1081
	

I will do this, if I can bring it to any
opportunity.

35
	

II,1,1085
	

Adieu.

36
	

II,3,1286
	

Beat me!

37
	

II,3,1517
	

I do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that
hunts, but one that fills up the cry. My money is
almost spent; I have been to-night exceedingly well
cudgelled; and I think the issue will be, I shall
have so much experience for my pains, and so, with
no money at all and a little more wit, return again to Venice.

38
	

IV,2,2946
	

I do not find that thou dealest justly with me.

39
	

IV,2,2948
	

Every day thou daffest me with some device, Iago;
and rather, as it seems to me now, keepest from me
all conveniency than suppliest me with the least
advantage of hope. I will indeed no longer endure
it, nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what
already I have foolishly suffered.

40
	

IV,2,2955
	

'Faith, I have heard too much, for your words and
performances are no kin together.

41
	

IV,2,2958
	

With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of
my means. The jewels you have had from me to
deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a
votarist: you have told me she hath received them
and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden
respect and acquaintance, but I find none.

42
	

IV,2,2965
	

Very well! go to! I cannot go to, man; nor 'tis
not very well: nay, I think it is scurvy, and begin
to find myself fobbed in it.

43
	

IV,2,2969
	

I tell you 'tis not very well. I will make myself
known to Desdemona: if she will return me my
jewels, I will give over my suit and repent my
unlawful solicitation; if not, assure yourself I
will seek satisfaction of you.

44
	

IV,2,2975
	

Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing.

45
	

IV,2,2981
	

It hath not appeared.

46
	

IV,2,2990
	

Well, what is it? is it within reason and compass?

47
	

IV,2,2993
	

Is that true? why, then Othello and Desdemona
return again to Venice.

48
	

IV,2,2999
	

How do you mean, removing of him?

49
	

IV,2,3002
	

And that you would have me to do?

50
	

IV,2,3015
	

I will hear further reason for this.

51
	

V,1,3141
	

Be near at hand; I may miscarry in't.

52
	

V,1,3144
	

I have no great devotion to the deed;
And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons:
'Tis but a man gone. Forth, my sword: he dies.

53
	

V,1,3160
	

I know his gait, 'tis he.—Villain, thou diest!

54
	

V,1,3166
	

O, I am slain!

55
	

V,1,3172
	

O, villain that I am!

56
	

V,1,3187
	

O wretched villain!

57
	

V,1,3191
	

Nobody come? then shall I bleed to death.

58
	

V,1,3211
	

O, help me here!

59
	

V,1,3215
	

O damn'd Iago! O inhuman dog!

1
	

I,1,5
	

'Sblood, but you will not hear me:
If ever I did dream of such a matter, Abhor me.

2
	

I,1,8
	

Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,
In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,
Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man,
I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:
But he; as loving his own pride and purposes,
Evades them, with a bombast circumstance
Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war;
And, in conclusion,
Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he,
'I have already chose my officer.'
And what was he?
Forsooth, a great arithmetician,
One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,
A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;
That never set a squadron in the field,
Nor the division of a battle knows
More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,
Wherein the toged consuls can propose
As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,
Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:
And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof
At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds
Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd
By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,
He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,
And I—God bless the mark!—his Moorship's ancient.

3
	

I,1,35
	

Why, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service,
Preferment goes by letter and affection,
And not by old gradation, where each second
Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself,
Whether I in any just term am affined
To love the Moor.

4
	

I,1,42
	

O, sir, content you;
I follow him to serve my turn upon him:
We cannot all be masters, nor all masters
Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark
Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,
That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,
Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,
For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd:
Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are
Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,
Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,
And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,
Do well thrive by them and when they have lined
their coats
Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;
And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,
It is as sure as you are Roderigo,
Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:
In following him, I follow but myself;
Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,
But seeming so, for my peculiar end:
For when my outward action doth demonstrate
The native act and figure of my heart
In compliment extern, 'tis not long after
But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve
For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.

5
	

I,1,70
	

Call up her father,
Rouse him: make after him, poison his delight,
Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,
And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,
Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,
Yet throw such changes of vexation on't,
As it may lose some colour.

6
	

I,1,78
	

Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell
As when, by night and negligence, the fire
Is spied in populous cities.

7
	

I,1,82
	

Awake! what, ho, Brabantio! thieves! thieves! thieves!
Look to your house, your daughter and your bags!
Thieves! thieves!

8
	

I,1,89
	

Are your doors lock'd?

9
	

I,1,91
	

'Zounds, sir, you're robb'd; for shame, put on
your gown;
Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;
Even now, now, very now, an old black ram
Is topping your white ewe. Arise, arise;
Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,
Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:
Arise, I say.

10
	

I,1,119
	

'Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not
serve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come to
do you service and you think we are ruffians, you'll
have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse;
you'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll have
coursers for cousins and gennets for germans.

11
	

I,1,126
	

I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter
and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.

12
	

I,1,129
	

You are—a senator.

13
	

I,1,158
	

Farewell; for I must leave you:
It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,
To be produced—as, if I stay, I shall—
Against the Moor: for, I do know, the state,
However this may gall him with some cheque,
Cannot with safety cast him, for he's embark'd
With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,
Which even now stand in act, that, for their souls,
Another of his fathom they have none,
To lead their business: in which regard,
Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains.
Yet, for necessity of present life,
I must show out a flag and sign of love,
Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,
Lead to the Sagittary the raised search;
And there will I be with him. So, farewell.

14
	

I,2,203
	

Though in the trade of war I have slain men,
Yet do I hold it very stuff o' the conscience
To do no contrived murder: I lack iniquity
Sometimes to do me service: nine or ten times
I had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs.

15
	

I,2,209
	

Nay, but he prated,
And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms
Against your honour
That, with the little godliness I have,
I did full hard forbear him. But, I pray you, sir,
Are you fast married? Be assured of this,
That the magnifico is much beloved,
And hath in his effect a voice potential
As double as the duke's: he will divorce you;
Or put upon you what restraint and grievance
The law, with all his might to enforce it on,
Will give him cable.

16
	

I,2,233
	

Those are the raised father and his friends:
You were best go in.

17
	

I,2,238
	

By Janus, I think no.

18
	

I,2,262
	

'Faith, he to-night hath boarded a land carack:
If it prove lawful prize, he's made for ever.

19
	

I,2,265
	

He's married.

20
	

I,2,268
	

Marry, to—Come, captain, will you go?

21
	

I,2,271
	

It is Brabantio. General, be advised;
He comes to bad intent.

22
	

I,2,278
	

You, Roderigo! come, sir, I am for you.

23
	

I,3,661
	

What say'st thou, noble heart?

24
	

I,3,663
	

Why, go to bed, and sleep.

25
	

I,3,665
	

If thou dost, I shall never love thee after. Why,
thou silly gentleman!

26
	

I,3,669
	

O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four
times seven years; and since I could distinguish
betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found man
that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say, I
would drown myself for the love of a guinea-hen, I
would change my humanity with a baboon.

27
	

I,3,677
	

Virtue! a fig! 'tis in ourselves that we are thus
or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which
our wills are gardeners: so that if we will plant
nettles, or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up
thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs, or
distract it with many, either to have it sterile
with idleness, or manured with industry, why, the
power and corrigible authority of this lies in our
wills. If the balance of our lives had not one
scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the
blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us
to most preposterous conclusions: but we have
reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal
stings, our unbitted lusts, whereof I take this that
you call love to be a sect or scion.

28
	

I,3,693
	

It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of
the will. Come, be a man. Drown thyself! drown
cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy
friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving with
cables of perdurable toughness; I could never
better stead thee than now. Put money in thy
purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favour with
an usurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse. It
cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her
love to the Moor,— put money in thy purse,—nor he
his to her: it was a violent commencement, and thou
shalt see an answerable sequestration:—put but
money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in
their wills: fill thy purse with money:—the food
that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be
to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She must
change for youth: when she is sated with his body,
she will find the error of her choice: she must
have change, she must: therefore put money in thy
purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a
more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money
thou canst: if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt
an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian not
too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou
shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of
drowning thyself! it is clean out of the way: seek
thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than
to be drowned and go without her.

29
	

I,3,723
	

Thou art sure of me:—go, make money:—I have told
thee often, and I re-tell thee again and again, I
hate the Moor: my cause is hearted; thine hath no
less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge
against him: if thou canst cuckold him, thou dost
thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many
events in the womb of time which will be delivered.
Traverse! go, provide thy money. We will have more
of this to-morrow. Adieu.

30
	

I,3,733
	

At my lodging.

31
	

I,3,735
	

Go to; farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo?

32
	

I,3,737
	

No more of drowning, do you hear?

33
	

I,3,740
	

Thus do I ever make my fool my purse:
For I mine own gain'd knowledge should profane,
If I would time expend with such a snipe.
But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor:
And it is thought abroad, that 'twixt my sheets
He has done my office: I know not if't be true;
But I, for mere suspicion in that kind,
Will do as if for surety. He holds me well;
The better shall my purpose work on him.
Cassio's a proper man: let me see now:
To get his place and to plume up my will
In double knavery—How, how? Let's see:—
After some time, to abuse Othello's ear
That he is too familiar with his wife.
He hath a person and a smooth dispose
To be suspected, framed to make women false.
The Moor is of a free and open nature,
That thinks men honest that but seem to be so,
And will as tenderly be led by the nose
As asses are.
I have't. It is engender'd. Hell and night
Must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light.

34
	

II,1,886
	

Sir, would she give you so much of her lips
As of her tongue she oft bestows on me,
You'll have enough.

35
	

II,1,890
	

In faith, too much;
I find it still, when I have list to sleep:
Marry, before your ladyship, I grant,
She puts her tongue a little in her heart,
And chides with thinking.

36
	

II,1,896
	

Come on, come on; you are pictures out of doors,
Bells in your parlors, wild-cats in your kitchens,
Saints m your injuries, devils being offended,
Players in your housewifery, and housewives' in your beds.

37
	

II,1,901
	

Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk:
You rise to play and go to bed to work.

38
	

II,1,904
	

No, let me not.

39
	

II,1,907
	

O gentle lady, do not put me to't;
For I am nothing, if not critical.

40
	

II,1,910
	

Ay, madam.

41
	

II,1,914
	

I am about it; but indeed my invention
Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frize;
It plucks out brains and all: but my Muse labours,
And thus she is deliver'd.
If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit,
The one's for use, the other useth it.

42
	

II,1,921
	

If she be black, and thereto have a wit,
She'll find a white that shall her blackness fit.

43
	

II,1,925
	

She never yet was foolish that was fair;
For even her folly help'd her to an heir.

44
	

II,1,930
	

There's none so foul and foolish thereunto,
But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do.

45
	

II,1,936
	

She that was ever fair and never proud,
Had tongue at will and yet was never loud,
Never lack'd gold and yet went never gay,
Fled from her wish and yet said 'Now I may,'
She that being anger'd, her revenge being nigh,
Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly,
She that in wisdom never was so frail
To change the cod's head for the salmon's tail;
She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind,
See suitors following and not look behind,
She was a wight, if ever such wight were,—

46
	

II,1,948
	

To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.

47
	

II,1,955
	

[Aside] He takes her by the palm: ay, well said,
whisper: with as little a web as this will I
ensnare as great a fly as Cassio. Ay, smile upon
her, do; I will gyve thee in thine own courtship.
You say true; 'tis so, indeed: if such tricks as
these strip you out of your lieutenantry, it had
been better you had not kissed your three fingers so
oft, which now again you are most apt to play the
sir in. Very good; well kissed! an excellent
courtesy! 'tis so, indeed. Yet again your fingers
to your lips? would they were clyster-pipes for your sake!
[Trumpet within]
The Moor! I know his trumpet.

48
	

II,1,994
	

[Aside] O, you are well tuned now!
But I'll set down the pegs that make this music,
As honest as I am.

49
	

II,1,1011
	

Do thou meet me presently at the harbour. Come
hither. If thou be'st valiant,— as, they say, base
men being in love have then a nobility in their
natures more than is native to them—list me. The
lieutenant tonight watches on the court of
guard:—first, I must tell thee this—Desdemona is
directly in love with him.

50
	

II,1,1019
	

Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed.
Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor,
but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies:
and will she love him still for prating? let not
thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed;
and what delight shall she have to look on the
devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of
sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to
give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour,
sympathy in years, manners and beauties; all which
the Moor is defective in: now, for want of these
required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will
find itself abused, begin to heave the gorge,
disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will
instruct her in it and compel her to some second
choice. Now, sir, this granted,—as it is a most
pregnant and unforced position—who stands so
eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio
does? a knave very voluble; no further
conscionable than in putting on the mere form of
civil and humane seeming, for the better compassing
of his salt and most hidden loose affection? why,
none; why, none: a slipper and subtle knave, a
finder of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and
counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never
present itself; a devilish knave. Besides, the
knave is handsome, young, and hath all those
requisites in him that folly and green minds look
after: a pestilent complete knave; and the woman
hath found him already.

51
	

II,1,1051
	

Blessed fig's-end! the wine she drinks is made of
grapes: if she had been blessed, she would never
have loved the Moor. Blessed pudding! Didst thou
not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? didst
not mark that?

52
	

II,1,1057
	

Lechery, by this hand; an index and obscure prologue
to the history of lust and foul thoughts. They met
so near with their lips that their breaths embraced
together. Villanous thoughts, Roderigo! when these
mutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand comes
the master and main exercise, the incorporate
conclusion, Pish! But, sir, be you ruled by me: I
have brought you from Venice. Watch you to-night;
for the command, I'll lay't upon you. Cassio knows
you not. I'll not be far from you: do you find
some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking
too loud, or tainting his discipline; or from what
other course you please, which the time shall more
favourably minister.

53
	

II,1,1072
	

Sir, he is rash and very sudden in choler, and haply
may strike at you: provoke him, that he may; for
even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to
mutiny; whose qualification shall come into no true
taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So
shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by
the means I shall then have to prefer them; and the
impediment most profitably removed, without the
which there were no expectation of our prosperity.

54
	

II,1,1083
	

I warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel:
I must fetch his necessaries ashore. Farewell.

55
	

II,1,1087
	

That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;
That she loves him, 'tis apt and of great credit:
The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,
Is of a constant, loving, noble nature,
And I dare think he'll prove to Desdemona
A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too;
Not out of absolute lust, though peradventure
I stand accountant for as great a sin,
But partly led to diet my revenge,
For that I do suspect the lusty Moor
Hath leap'd into my seat; the thought whereof
Doth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards;
And nothing can or shall content my soul
Till I am even'd with him, wife for wife,
Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor
At least into a jealousy so strong
That judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do,
If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trash
For his quick hunting, stand the putting on,
I'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,
Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb—
For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too—
Make the Moor thank me, love me and reward me.
For making him egregiously an ass
And practising upon his peace and quiet
Even to madness. 'Tis here, but yet confused:
Knavery's plain face is never seen tin used.

56
	

II,3,1147
	

Not this hour, lieutenant; 'tis not yet ten o' the
clock. Our general cast us thus early for the love
of his Desdemona; who let us not therefore blame:
he hath not yet made wanton the night with her; and
she is sport for Jove.

57
	

II,3,1153
	

And, I'll warrant her, fun of game.

58
	

II,3,1155
	

What an eye she has! methinks it sounds a parley of
provocation.

59
	

II,3,1158
	

And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?

60
	

II,3,1160
	

Well, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant, I
have a stoup of wine; and here without are a brace
of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to
the health of black Othello.

61
	

II,3,1168
	

O, they are our friends; but one cup: I'll drink for
you.

62
	

II,3,1174
	

What, man! 'tis a night of revels: the gallants
desire it.

63
	

II,3,1177
	

Here at the door; I pray you, call them in.

64
	

II,3,1180
	

If I can fasten but one cup upon him,
With that which he hath drunk to-night already,
He'll be as full of quarrel and offence
As my young mistress' dog. Now, my sick fool Roderigo,
Whom love hath turn'd almost the wrong side out,
To Desdemona hath to-night caroused
Potations pottle-deep; and he's to watch:
Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits,
That hold their honours in a wary distance,
The very elements of this warlike isle,
Have I to-night fluster'd with flowing cups,
And they watch too. Now, 'mongst this flock of drunkards,
Am I to put our Cassio in some action
That may offend the isle.—But here they come:
If consequence do but approve my dream,
My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.

65
	

II,3,1200
	

Some wine, ho!
[Sings]
And let me the canakin clink, clink;
And let me the canakin clink
A soldier's a man;
A life's but a span;
Why, then, let a soldier drink.
Some wine, boys!

66
	

II,3,1209
	

I learned it in England, where, indeed, they are
most potent in potting: your Dane, your German, and
your swag-bellied Hollander—Drink, ho!—are nothing
to your English.

67
	

II,3,1214
	

Why, he drinks you, with facility, your Dane dead
drunk; he sweats not to overthrow your Almain; he
gives your Hollander a vomit, ere the next pottle
can be filled.

68
	

II,3,1220
	

O sweet England!
King Stephen was a worthy peer,
His breeches cost him but a crown;
He held them sixpence all too dear,
With that he call'd the tailor lown.
He was a wight of high renown,
And thou art but of low degree:
'Tis pride that pulls the country down;
Then take thine auld cloak about thee.
Some wine, ho!

69
	

II,3,1231
	

Will you hear't again?

70
	

II,3,1235
	

It's true, good lieutenant.

71
	

II,3,1238
	

And so do I too, lieutenant.

72
	

II,3,1251
	

You see this fellow that is gone before;
He is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar
And give direction: and do but see his vice;
'Tis to his virtue a just equinox,
The one as long as the other: 'tis pity of him.
I fear the trust Othello puts him in.
On some odd time of his infirmity,
Will shake this island.

73
	

II,3,1260
	

'Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep:
He'll watch the horologe a double set,
If drink rock not his cradle.

74
	

II,3,1269
	

[Aside to him] How now, Roderigo!
I pray you, after the lieutenant; go.

75
	

II,3,1277
	

Not I, for this fair island:
I do love Cassio well; and would do much
To cure him of this evil—But, hark! what noise?

76
	

II,3,1298
	

[Aside to RODERIGO] Away, I say; go out, and cry a mutiny.
[Exit RODERIGO]
Nay, good lieutenant,—alas, gentlemen;—
Help, ho!—Lieutenant,—sir,—Montano,—sir;
Help, masters!—Here's a goodly watch indeed!
[Bell rings]
Who's that which rings the bell?—Diablo, ho!
The town will rise: God's will, lieutenant, hold!
You will be shamed for ever.

77
	

II,3,1312
	

Hold, ho! Lieutenant,—sir—Montano,—gentlemen,—
Have you forgot all sense of place and duty?
Hold! the general speaks to you; hold, hold, for shame!

78
	

II,3,1325
	

I do not know: friends all but now, even now,
In quarter, and in terms like bride and groom
Devesting them for bed; and then, but now—
As if some planet had unwitted men—
Swords out, and tilting one at other's breast,
In opposition bloody. I cannot speak
Any beginning to this peevish odds;
And would in action glorious I had lost
Those legs that brought me to a part of it!

79
	

II,3,1369
	

Touch me not so near:
I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth
Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio;
Yet, I persuade myself, to speak the truth
Shall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general.
Montano and myself being in speech,
There comes a fellow crying out for help:
And Cassio following him with determined sword,
To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman
Steps in to Cassio, and entreats his pause:
Myself the crying fellow did pursue,
Lest by his clamour—as it so fell out—
The town might fall in fright: he, swift of foot,
Outran my purpose; and I return'd the rather
For that I heard the clink and fall of swords,
And Cassio high in oath; which till to-night
I ne'er might say before. When I came back—
For this was brief—I found them close together,
At blow and thrust; even as again they were
When you yourself did part them.
More of this matter cannot I report:
But men are men; the best sometimes forget:
Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,
As men in rage strike those that wish them best,
Yet surely Cassio, I believe, received
From him that fled some strange indignity,
Which patience could not pass.

80
	

II,3,1413
	

What, are you hurt, lieutenant?

81
	

II,3,1415
	

Marry, heaven forbid!

82
	

II,3,1420
	

As I am an honest man, I thought you had received
some bodily wound; there is more sense in that than
in reputation. Reputation is an idle and most false
imposition: oft got without merit, and lost without
deserving: you have lost no reputation at all,
unless you repute yourself such a loser. What, man!
there are ways to recover the general again: you
are but now cast in his mood, a punishment more in
policy than in malice, even so as one would beat his
offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion: sue
to him again, and he's yours.

83
	

II,3,1438
	

What was he that you followed with your sword? What
had he done to you?

84
	

II,3,1441
	

Is't possible?

85
	

II,3,1447
	

Why, but you are now well enough: how came you thus
recovered?

86
	

II,3,1452
	

Come, you are too severe a moraler: as the time,
the place, and the condition of this country
stands, I could heartily wish this had not befallen;
but, since it is as it is, mend it for your own good.

87
	

II,3,1462
	

Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature,
if it be well used: exclaim no more against it.
And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.

88
	

II,3,1466
	

You or any man living may be drunk! at a time, man.
I'll tell you what you shall do. Our general's wife
is now the general: may say so in this respect, for
that he hath devoted and given up himself to the
contemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts and
graces: confess yourself freely to her; importune
her help to put you in your place again: she is of
so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition,
she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more
than she is requested: this broken joint between
you and her husband entreat her to splinter; and, my
fortunes against any lay worth naming, this
crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before.

89
	

II,3,1480
	

I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.

90
	

II,3,1484
	

You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant; I
must to the watch.

91
	

II,3,1488
	

And what's he then that says I play the villain?
When this advice is free I give and honest,
Probal to thinking and indeed the course
To win the Moor again? For 'tis most easy
The inclining Desdemona to subdue
In any honest suit: she's framed as fruitful
As the free elements. And then for her
To win the Moor—were't to renounce his baptism,
All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,
His soul is so enfetter'd to her love,
That she may make, unmake, do what she list,
Even as her appetite shall play the god
With his weak function. How am I then a villain
To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,
Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!
When devils will the blackest sins put on,
They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,
As I do now: for whiles this honest fool
Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes
And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,
I'll pour this pestilence into his ear,
That she repeals him for her body's lust;
And by how much she strives to do him good,
She shall undo her credit with the Moor.
So will I turn her virtue into pitch,
And out of her own goodness make the net
That shall enmesh them all.
[Re-enter RODERIGO]
How now, Roderigo!

92
	

II,3,1523
	

How poor are they that have not patience!
What wound did ever heal but by degrees?
Thou know'st we work by wit, and not by witchcraft;
And wit depends on dilatory time.
Does't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee.
And thou, by that small hurt, hast cashier'd Cassio:
Though other things grow fair against the sun,
Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe:
Content thyself awhile. By the mass, 'tis morning;
Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.
Retire thee; go where thou art billeted:
Away, I say; thou shalt know more hereafter:
Nay, get thee gone.
[Exit RODERIGO]
Two things are to be done:
My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress;
I'll set her on;
Myself the while to draw the Moor apart,
And bring him jump when he may Cassio find
Soliciting his wife: ay, that's the way
Dull not device by coldness and delay.

93
	

III,1,1582
	

You have not been a-bed, then?

94
	

III,1,1588
	

I'll send her to you presently;
And I'll devise a mean to draw the Moor
Out of the way, that your converse and business
May be more free.

95
	

III,2,1621
	

Well, my good lord, I'll do't.

96
	

III,3,1664
	

Ha! I like not that.

97
	

III,3,1666
	

Nothing, my lord: or if—I know not what.

98
	

III,3,1668
	

Cassio, my lord! No, sure, I cannot think it,
That he would steal away so guilty-like,
Seeing you coming.

99
	

III,3,1731
	

My noble lord—

100
	

III,3,1733
	

Did Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady,
Know of your love?

101
	

III,3,1736
	

But for a satisfaction of my thought;
No further harm.

102
	

III,3,1739
	

I did not think he had been acquainted with her.

103
	

III,3,1741
	

Indeed!

104
	

III,3,1744
	

Honest, my lord!

105
	

III,3,1746
	

My lord, for aught I know.

106
	

III,3,1748
	

Think, my lord!

107
	

III,3,1761
	

My lord, you know I love you.

108
	

III,3,1770
	

For Michael Cassio,
I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.

109
	

III,3,1773
	

Men should be what they seem;
Or those that be not, would they might seem none!

110
	

III,3,1776
	

Why, then, I think Cassio's an honest man.

111
	

III,3,1781
	

Good my lord, pardon me:
Though I am bound to every act of duty,
I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.
Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false;
As where's that palace whereinto foul things
Sometimes intrude not? who has a breast so pure,
But some uncleanly apprehensions
Keep leets and law-days and in session sit
With meditations lawful?

112
	

III,3,1793
	

I do beseech you—
Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,
As, I confess, it is my nature's plague
To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy
Shapes faults that are not—that your wisdom yet,
From one that so imperfectly conceits,
Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble
Out of his scattering and unsure observance.
It were not for your quiet nor your good,
Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,
To let you know my thoughts.

113
	

III,3,1805
	

Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,
Is the immediate jewel of their souls:
Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;
'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands:
But he that filches from me my good name
Robs me of that which not enriches him
And makes me poor indeed.

114
	

III,3,1813
	

You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;
Nor shall not, whilst 'tis in my custody.

115
	

III,3,1816
	

O, beware, my lord, of jealousy;
It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock
The meat it feeds on; that cuckold lives in bliss
Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;
But, O, what damned minutes tells he o'er
Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!

116
	

III,3,1823
	

Poor and content is rich and rich enough,
But riches fineless is as poor as winter
To him that ever fears he shall be poor.
Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend
From jealousy!

117
	

III,3,1845
	

I am glad of it; for now I shall have reason
To show the love and duty that I bear you
With franker spirit: therefore, as I am bound,
Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.
Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;
Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure:
I would not have your free and noble nature,
Out of self-bounty, be abused; look to't:
I know our country disposition well;
In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks
They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience
Is not to leave't undone, but keep't unknown.

118
	

III,3,1858
	

She did deceive her father, marrying you;
And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks,
She loved them most.

119
	

III,3,1862
	

Why, go to then;
She that, so young, could give out such a seeming,
To seal her father's eyes up close as oak-
He thought 'twas witchcraft—but I am much to blame;
I humbly do beseech you of your pardon
For too much loving you.

120
	

III,3,1869
	

I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits.

121
	

III,3,1871
	

I' faith, I fear it has.
I hope you will consider what is spoke
Comes from my love. But I do see you're moved:
I am to pray you not to strain my speech
To grosser issues nor to larger reach
Than to suspicion.

122
	

III,3,1878
	

Should you do so, my lord,
My speech should fall into such vile success
As my thoughts aim not at. Cassio's my worthy friend—
My lord, I see you're moved.

123
	

III,3,1884
	

Long live she so! and long live you to think so!

124
	

III,3,1886
	

Ay, there's the point: as—to be bold with you—
Not to affect many proposed matches
Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,
Whereto we see in all things nature tends—
Foh! one may smell in such a will most rank,
Foul disproportion thoughts unnatural.
But pardon me; I do not in position
Distinctly speak of her; though I may fear
Her will, recoiling to her better judgment,
May fall to match you with her country forms
And happily repent.

125
	

III,3,1900
	

[Going] My lord, I take my leave.

126
	

III,3,1903
	

[Returning] My lord, I would I might entreat
your honour
To scan this thing no further; leave it to time:
Though it be fit that Cassio have his place,
For sure, he fills it up with great ability,
Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile,
You shall by that perceive him and his means:
Note, if your lady strain his entertainment
With any strong or vehement importunity;
Much will be seen in that. In the mean time,
Let me be thought too busy in my fears—
As worthy cause I have to fear I am—
And hold her free, I do beseech your honour.

127
	

III,3,1917
	

I once more take my leave.

128
	

III,3,1968
	

How now! what do you here alone?

129
	

III,3,1970
	

A thing for me? it is a common thing—

130
	

III,3,1972
	

To have a foolish wife.

131
	

III,3,1975
	

What handkerchief?

132
	

III,3,1979
	

Hast stol'n it from her?

133
	

III,3,1983
	

A good wench; give it me.

134
	

III,3,1987
	

[Snatching it] Why, what's that to you?

135
	

III,3,1991
	

Be not acknown on 't; I have use for it.
Go, leave me.
[Exit EMILIA]
I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin,
And let him find it. Trifles light as air
Are to the jealous confirmations strong
As proofs of holy writ: this may do something.
The Moor already changes with my poison:
Dangerous conceits are, in their natures, poisons.
Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,
But with a little act upon the blood.
Burn like the mines of Sulphur. I did say so:
Look, where he comes!
[Re-enter OTHELLO]
Not poppy, nor mandragora,
Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world,
Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep
Which thou owedst yesterday.

136
	

III,3,2010
	

Why, how now, general! no more of that.

137
	

III,3,2014
	

How now, my lord!

138
	

III,3,2021
	

I am sorry to hear this.

139
	

III,3,2035
	

Is't possible, my lord?

140
	

III,3,2041
	

Is't come to this?

141
	

III,3,2045
	

My noble lord,—

142
	

III,3,2052
	

O grace! O heaven forgive me!
Are you a man? have you a soul or sense?
God be wi' you; take mine office. O wretched fool.
That livest to make thine honesty a vice!
O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world,
To be direct and honest is not safe.
I thank you for this profit; and from hence
I'll love no friend, sith love breeds such offence.

143
	

III,3,2061
	

I should be wise, for honesty's a fool
And loses that it works for.

144
	

III,3,2071
	

I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion:
I do repent me that I put it to you.
You would be satisfied?

145
	

III,3,2075
	

And may: but, how? how satisfied, my lord?
Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on—
Behold her topp'd?

146
	

III,3,2079
	

It were a tedious difficulty, I think,
To bring them to that prospect: damn them then,
If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster
More than their own! What then? how then?
What shall I say? Where's satisfaction?
It is impossible you should see this,
Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,
As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross
As ignorance made drunk. But yet, I say,
If imputation and strong circumstances,
Which lead directly to the door of truth,
Will give you satisfaction, you may have't.

147
	

III,3,2092
	

I do not like the office:
But, sith I am enter'd in this cause so far,
Prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love,
I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately;
And, being troubled with a raging tooth,
I could not sleep.
There are a kind of men so loose of soul,
That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs:
One of this kind is Cassio:
In sleep I heard him say 'Sweet Desdemona,
Let us be wary, let us hide our loves;'
And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,
Cry 'O sweet creature!' and then kiss me hard,
As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots
That grew upon my lips: then laid his leg
Over my thigh, and sigh'd, and kiss'd; and then
Cried 'Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!'

148
	

III,3,2110
	

Nay, this was but his dream.

149
	

III,3,2113
	

And this may help to thicken other proofs
That do demonstrate thinly.

150
	

III,3,2116
	

Nay, but be wise: yet we see nothing done;
She may be honest yet. Tell me but this,
Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief
Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?

151
	

III,3,2121
	

I know not that; but such a handkerchief—
I am sure it was your wife's—did I to-day
See Cassio wipe his beard with.

152
	

III,3,2125
	

If it be that, or any that was hers,
It speaks against her with the other proofs.

153
	

III,3,2136
	

Yet be content.

154
	

III,3,2138
	

Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change.

155
	

III,3,2150
	

Do not rise yet.
[Kneels]
Witness, you ever-burning lights above,
You elements that clip us round about,
Witness that here Iago doth give up
The execution of his wit, hands, heart,
To wrong'd Othello's service! Let him command,
And to obey shall be in me remorse,
What bloody business ever.

156
	

III,3,2165
	

My friend is dead; 'tis done at your request:
But let her live.

157
	

III,3,2171
	

I am your own for ever.

158
	

III,4,2298
	

There is no other way; 'tis she must do't:
And, lo, the happiness! go, and importune her.

159
	

III,4,2324
	

Is my lord angry?

160
	

III,4,2327
	

Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon,
When it hath blown his ranks into the air,
And, like the devil, from his very arm
Puff'd his own brother:—and can he be angry?
Something of moment then: I will go meet him:
There's matter in't indeed, if he be angry.

161
	

IV,1,2409
	

Will you think so?

162
	

IV,1,2411
	

What,
To kiss in private?

163
	

IV,1,2414
	

Or to be naked with her friend in bed
An hour or more, not meaning any harm?

164
	

IV,1,2420
	

So they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip:
But if I give my wife a handkerchief,—

165
	

IV,1,2423
	

Why, then, 'tis hers, my lord; and, being hers,
She may, I think, bestow't on any man.

166
	

IV,1,2427
	

Her honour is an essence that's not seen;
They have it very oft that have it not:
But, for the handkerchief,—

167
	

IV,1,2434
	

Ay, what of that?

168
	

IV,1,2436
	

What,
If I had said I had seen him do you wrong?
Or heard him say,—as knaves be such abroad,
Who having, by their own importunate suit,
Or voluntary dotage of some mistress,
Convinced or supplied them, cannot choose
But they must blab—

169
	

IV,1,2444
	

He hath, my lord; but be you well assured,
No more than he'll unswear.

170
	

IV,1,2447
	

'Faith, that he did—I know not what he did.

171
	

IV,1,2449
	

Lie—

172
	

IV,1,2451
	

With her, on her; what you will.

173
	

IV,1,2462
	

Work on,
My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught;
And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,
All guiltless, meet reproach. What, ho! my lord!
My lord, I say! Othello!
[Enter CASSIO]
How now, Cassio!

174
	

IV,1,2470
	

My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy:
This is his second fit; he had one yesterday.

175
	

IV,1,2473
	

No, forbear;
The lethargy must have his quiet course:
If not, he foams at mouth and by and by
Breaks out to savage madness. Look he stirs:
Do you withdraw yourself a little while,
He will recover straight: when he is gone,
I would on great occasion speak with you.
[Exit CASSIO]
How is it, general? have you not hurt your head?

176
	

IV,1,2483
	

I mock you! no, by heaven.
Would you would bear your fortune like a man!

177
	

IV,1,2486
	

There's many a beast then in a populous city,
And many a civil monster.

178
	

IV,1,2489
	

Good sir, be a man;
Think every bearded fellow that's but yoked
May draw with you: there's millions now alive
That nightly lie in those unproper beds
Which they dare swear peculiar: your case is better.
O, 'tis the spite of hell, the fiend's arch-mock,
To lip a wanton in a secure couch,
And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know;
And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.

179
	

IV,1,2499
	

Stand you awhile apart;
Confine yourself but in a patient list.
Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief—
A passion most unsuiting such a man—
Cassio came hither: I shifted him away,
And laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy,
Bade him anon return and here speak with me;
The which he promised. Do but encave yourself,
And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns,
That dwell in every region of his face;
For I will make him tell the tale anew,
Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when
He hath, and is again to cope your wife:
I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience;
Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen,
And nothing of a man.

180
	

IV,1,2518
	

That's not amiss;
But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?
[OTHELLO retires]
Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,
A housewife that by selling her desires
Buys herself bread and clothes: it is a creature
That dotes on Cassio; as 'tis the strumpet's plague
To beguile many and be beguiled by one:
He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain
From the excess of laughter. Here he comes:
[Re-enter CASSIO]
As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad;
And his unbookish jealousy must construe
Poor Cassio's smiles, gestures and light behavior,
Quite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant?

181
	

IV,1,2535
	

Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on't.
[Speaking lower]
Now, if this suit lay in Bianco's power,
How quickly should you speed!

182
	

IV,1,2541
	

I never knew woman love man so.

183
	

IV,1,2544
	

Do you hear, Cassio?

184
	

IV,1,2547
	

She gives it out that you shall marry hey:
Do you intend it?

185
	

IV,1,2555
	

'Faith, the cry goes that you shall marry her.

186
	

IV,1,2557
	

I am a very villain else.

187
	

IV,1,2575
	

Before me! look, where she comes.

188
	

IV,1,2592
	

After her, after her.

189
	

IV,1,2594
	

Will you sup there?

190
	

IV,1,2596
	

Well, I may chance to see you; for I would very fain
speak with you.

191
	

IV,1,2599
	

Go to; say no more.

192
	

IV,1,2602
	

Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?

193
	

IV,1,2604
	

And did you see the handkerchief?

194
	

IV,1,2606
	

Yours by this hand: and to see how he prizes the
foolish woman your wife! she gave it him, and he
hath given it his whore.

195
	

IV,1,2611
	

Nay, you must forget that.

196
	

IV,1,2617
	

Nay, that's not your way.

197
	

IV,1,2622
	

She's the worse for all this.

198
	

IV,1,2625
	

Ay, too gentle.

199
	

IV,1,2628
	

If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her
patent to offend; for, if it touch not you, it comes
near nobody.

200
	

IV,1,2632
	

O, 'tis foul in her.

201
	

IV,1,2634
	

That's fouler.

202
	

IV,1,2638
	

Do it not with poison, strangle her in her bed, even
the bed she hath contaminated.

203
	

IV,1,2641
	

And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker: you
shall hear more by midnight.

204
	

IV,1,2646
	

Something from Venice, sure. 'Tis Lodovico
Come from the duke: and, see, your wife is with him.

205
	

IV,1,2656
	

I am very glad to see you, signior
Welcome to Cyprus.

206
	

IV,1,2659
	

Lives, sir.

207
	

IV,1,2717
	

He is much changed.

208
	

IV,1,2719
	

He's that he is: I may not breathe my censure
What he might be: if what he might he is not,
I would to heaven he were!

209
	

IV,1,2723
	

'Faith, that was not so well; yet would I knew
That stroke would prove the worst!

210
	

IV,1,2728
	

Alas, alas!
It is not honesty in me to speak
What I have seen and known. You shall observe him,
And his own courses will denote him so
That I may save my speech: do but go after,
And mark how he continues.

211
	

IV,2,2872
	

What is your pleasure, madam?
How is't with you?

212
	

IV,2,2878
	

What's the matter, lady?

213
	

IV,2,2883
	

What name, fair lady?

214
	

IV,2,2887
	

Why did he so?

215
	

IV,2,2889
	

Do not weep, do not weep. Alas the day!

216
	

IV,2,2894
	

Beshrew him for't!
How comes this trick upon him?

217
	

IV,2,2901
	

Fie, there is no such man; it is impossible.

218
	

IV,2,2912
	

Speak within door.

219
	

IV,2,2916
	

You are a fool; go to.

220
	

IV,2,2934
	

I pray you, be content; 'tis but his humour:
The business of the state does him offence,
And he does chide with you.

221
	

IV,2,2938
	

'Tis but so, I warrant.
[Trumpets within]
Hark, how these instruments summon to supper!
The messengers of Venice stay the meat;
Go in, and weep not; all things shall be well.
[Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA]
[Enter RODERIGO]
How now, Roderigo!

222
	

IV,2,2947
	

What in the contrary?

223
	

IV,2,2954
	

Will you hear me, Roderigo?

224
	

IV,2,2957
	

You charge me most unjustly.

225
	

IV,2,2964
	

Well; go to; very well.

226
	

IV,2,2968
	

Very well.

227
	

IV,2,2974
	

You have said now.

228
	

IV,2,2976
	

Why, now I see there's mettle in thee, and even from
this instant to build on thee a better opinion than
ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo: thou hast
taken against me a most just exception; but yet, I
protest, I have dealt most directly in thy affair.

229
	

IV,2,2982
	

I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your
suspicion is not without wit and judgment. But,
Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which I
have greater reason to believe now than ever, I mean
purpose, courage and valour, this night show it: if
thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona,
take me from this world with treachery and devise
engines for my life.

230
	

IV,2,2991
	

Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice
to depute Cassio in Othello's place.

231
	

IV,2,2995
	

O, no; he goes into Mauritania and takes away with
him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be
lingered here by some accident: wherein none can be
so determinate as the removing of Cassio.

232
	

IV,2,3000
	

Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place;
knocking out his brains.

233
	

IV,2,3003
	

Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right.
He sups to-night with a harlotry, and thither will I
go to him: he knows not yet of his horrorable
fortune. If you will watch his going thence, which
I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one,
you may take him at your pleasure: I will be near
to second your attempt, and he shall fall between
us. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with
me; I will show you such a necessity in his death
that you shall think yourself bound to put it on
him. It is now high suppertime, and the night grows
to waste: about it.

234
	

IV,2,3016
	

And you shall be satisfied.

235
	

V,1,3136
	

Here, stand behind this bulk; straight will he come:
Wear thy good rapier bare, and put it home:
Quick, quick; fear nothing; I'll be at thy elbow:
It makes us, or it mars us; think on that,
And fix most firm thy resolution.

236
	

V,1,3142
	

Here, at thy hand: be bold, and take thy stand.

237
	

V,1,3147
	

I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense,
And he grows angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio,
Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other,
Every way makes my gain: live Roderigo,
He calls me to a restitution large
Of gold and jewels that I bobb'd from him,
As gifts to Desdemona;
It must not be: if Cassio do remain,
He hath a daily beauty in his life
That makes me ugly; and, besides, the Moor
May unfold me to him; there stand I in much peril:
No, he must die. But so: I hear him coming.

238
	

V,1,3195
	

Who's there? whose noise is this that ones on murder?

239
	

V,1,3197
	

Did not you hear a cry?

240
	

V,1,3199
	

What's the matter?

241
	

V,1,3202
	

What are you here that cry so grievously?

242
	

V,1,3205
	

O me, lieutenant! what villains have done this?

243
	

V,1,3208
	

O treacherous villains!
What are you there? come in, and give some help.

244
	

V,1,3213
	

O murderous slave! O villain!

245
	

V,1,3216
	

Kill men i' the dark!—Where be these bloody thieves?—
How silent is this town!—Ho! murder! murder!—
What may you be? are you of good or evil?

246
	

V,1,3220
	

Signior Lodovico?

247
	

V,1,3222
	

I cry you mercy. Here's Cassio hurt by villains.

248
	

V,1,3224
	

How is't, brother!

249
	

V,1,3226
	

Marry, heaven forbid!
Light, gentlemen; I'll bind it with my shirt.

250
	

V,1,3230
	

Who is't that cried!

251
	

V,1,3233
	

O notable strumpet! Cassio, may you suspect
Who they should be that have thus many led you?

252
	

V,1,3237
	

Lend me a garter. So. O, for a chair,
To bear him easily hence!

253
	

V,1,3240
	

Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash
To be a party in this injury.
Patience awhile, good Cassio. Come, come;
Lend me a light. Know we this face or no?
Alas my friend and my dear countryman
Roderigo! no:—yes, sure: O heaven! Roderigo.

254
	

V,1,3247
	

Even he, sir; did you know him?

255
	

V,1,3249
	

Signior Gratiano? I cry you gentle pardon;
These bloody accidents must excuse my manners,
That so neglected you.

256
	

V,1,3253
	

How do you, Cassio? O, a chair, a chair!

257
	

V,1,3255
	

He, he 'tis he.
[A chair brought in]
O, that's well said; the chair!

258
	

V,1,3266
	

[To BIANCA] What, look you pale? O, bear him out
o' the air.
[CASSIO and RODERIGO are borne off]
Stay you, good gentlemen. Look you pale, mistress?
Do you perceive the gastness of her eye?
Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon.
Behold her well; I pray you, look upon her:
Do you see, gentlemen? nay, guiltiness will speak,
Though tongues were out of use.

259
	

V,1,3277
	

Cassio hath here been set on in the dark
By Roderigo and fellows that are scaped:
He's almost slain, and Roderigo dead.

260
	

V,1,3281
	

This is the fruit of whoring. Prithee, Emilia,
Go know of Cassio where he supp'd to-night.
[To BIANCA]
What, do you shake at that?

261
	

V,1,3286
	

O, did he so? I charge you, go with me.

262
	

V,1,3291
	

Kind gentlemen, let's go see poor Cassio dress'd.
Come, mistress, you must tell's another tale.
Emilia run you to the citadel,
And tell my lord and lady what hath happ'd.
Will you go on? I pray.
[Aside]
This is the night
That either makes me or fordoes me quite.

263
	

V,2,3513
	

I told him what I thought, and told no more
Than what he found himself was apt and true.

264
	

V,2,3516
	

I did.

265
	

V,2,3520
	

With Cassio, mistress. Go to, charm your tongue.

266
	

V,2,3532
	

What, are you mad? I charge you, get you home.

267
	

V,2,3560
	

Come, hold your peace.

268
	

V,2,3565
	

Be wise, and get you home.

269
	

V,2,3575
	

Villanous whore!

270
	

V,2,3578
	

Filth, thou liest!

271
	

V,2,3649
	

I bleed, sir; but not kill'd.

272
	

V,2,3665
	

Demand me nothing: what you know, you know:
From this time forth I never will speak word.

1
	

I,2,243
	

The duke does greet you, general,
And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance,
Even on the instant.

2
	

I,2,247
	

Something from Cyprus as I may divine:
It is a business of some heat: the galleys
Have sent a dozen sequent messengers
This very night at one another's heels,
And many of the consuls, raised and met,
Are at the duke's already: you have been
hotly call'd for;
When, being not at your lodging to be found,
The senate hath sent about three several guests
To search you out.

3
	

I,2,261
	

Ancient, what makes he here?

4
	

I,2,264
	

I do not understand.

5
	

I,2,266
	

To who?

6
	

I,2,270
	

Here comes another troop to seek for you.

7
	

II,1,812
	

Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle,
That so approve the Moor! O, let the heavens
Give him defence against the elements,
For I have lost us him on a dangerous sea.

8
	

II,1,817
	

His bark is stoutly timber'd, his pilot
Of very expert and approved allowance;
Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death,
Stand in bold cure.

9
	

II,1,823
	

What noise?

10
	

II,1,826
	

My hopes do shape him for the governor.

11
	

II,1,830
	

I pray you, sir, go forth,
And give us truth who 'tis that is arrived.

12
	

II,1,835
	

Most fortunately: he hath achieved a maid
That paragons description and wild fame;
One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,
And in the essential vesture of creation
Does tire the ingener.
[Re-enter second Gentleman]
How now! who has put in?

13
	

II,1,843
	

Has had most favourable and happy speed:
Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds,
The gutter'd rocks and congregated sands—
Traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel,—
As having sense of beauty, do omit
Their mortal natures, letting go safely by
The divine Desdemona.

14
	

II,1,851
	

She that I spake of, our great captain's captain,
Left in the conduct of the bold Iago,
Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts
A se'nnight's speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,
And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,
That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,
Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms,
Give renew'd fire to our extincted spirits
And bring all Cyprus comfort!
[Enter DESDEMONA, EMILIA, IAGO, RODERIGO, and Attendants]
O, behold,
The riches of the ship is come on shore!
Ye men of Cyprus, let her have your knees.
Hail to thee, lady! and the grace of heaven,
Before, behind thee, and on every hand,
Enwheel thee round!

15
	

II,1,869
	

He is not yet arrived: nor know I aught
But that he's well and will be shortly here.

16
	

II,1,872
	

The great contention of the sea and skies
Parted our fellowship—But, hark! a sail.

17
	

II,1,877
	

See for the news.
[Exit Gentleman]
Good ancient, you are welcome.
[To EMILIA]
Welcome, mistress.
Let it not gall your patience, good Iago,
That I extend my manners; 'tis my breeding
That gives me this bold show of courtesy.

18
	

II,1,953
	

He speaks home, madam: You may relish him more in
the soldier than in the scholar.

19
	

II,1,968
	

'Tis truly so.

20
	

II,1,970
	

Lo, where he comes!

21
	

II,3,1133
	

Iago hath direction what to do;
But, notwithstanding, with my personal eye
Will I look to't.

22
	

II,3,1146
	

Welcome, Iago; we must to the watch.

23
	

II,3,1152
	

She's a most exquisite lady.

24
	

II,3,1154
	

Indeed, she's a most fresh and delicate creature.

25
	

II,3,1157
	

An inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest.

26
	

II,3,1159
	

She is indeed perfection.

27
	

II,3,1164
	

Not to-night, good Iago: I have very poor and
unhappy brains for drinking: I could well wish
courtesy would invent some other custom of
entertainment.

28
	

II,3,1170
	

I have drunk but one cup to-night, and that was
craftily qualified too, and, behold, what innovation
it makes here: I am unfortunate in the infirmity,
and dare not task my weakness with any more.

29
	

II,3,1176
	

Where are they?

30
	

II,3,1178
	

I'll do't; but it dislikes me.

31
	

II,3,1197
	

'Fore God, they have given me a rouse already.

32
	

II,3,1208
	

'Fore God, an excellent song.

33
	

II,3,1213
	

Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking?

34
	

II,3,1218
	

To the health of our general!

35
	

II,3,1230
	

Why, this is a more exquisite song than the other.

36
	

II,3,1232
	

No; for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that
does those things. Well, God's above all; and there
be souls must be saved, and there be souls must not be saved.

37
	

II,3,1236
	

For mine own part,—no offence to the general, nor
any man of quality,—I hope to be saved.

38
	

II,3,1239
	

Ay, but, by your leave, not before me; the
lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient. Let's
have no more of this; let's to our affairs.—Forgive
us our sins!—Gentlemen, let's look to our business.
Do not think, gentlemen. I am drunk: this is my
ancient; this is my right hand, and this is my left:
I am not drunk now; I can stand well enough, and
speak well enough.

39
	

II,3,1248
	

Why, very well then; you must not think then that I am drunk.

40
	

II,3,1282
	

You rogue! you rascal!

41
	

II,3,1284
	

A knave teach me my duty!
I'll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle.

42
	

II,3,1287
	

Dost thou prate, rogue?

43
	

II,3,1292
	

Let me go, sir,
Or I'll knock you o'er the mazzard.

44
	

II,3,1296
	

Drunk!

45
	

II,3,1335
	

I pray you, pardon me; I cannot speak.

46
	

II,3,1414
	

Ay, past all surgery.

47
	

II,3,1416
	

Reputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have lost
my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of
myself, and what remains is bestial. My reputation,
Iago, my reputation!

48
	

II,3,1431
	

I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so
good a commander with so slight, so drunken, and so
indiscreet an officer. Drunk? and speak parrot?
and squabble? swagger? swear? and discourse
fustian with one's own shadow? O thou invisible
spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by,
let us call thee devil!

49
	

II,3,1440
	

I know not.

50
	

II,3,1442
	

I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly;
a quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O God, that men
should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away
their brains! that we should, with joy, pleasance
revel and applause, transform ourselves into beasts!

51
	

II,3,1449
	

It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place
to the devil wrath; one unperfectness shows me
another, to make me frankly despise myself.

52
	

II,3,1456
	

I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me
I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra,
such an answer would stop them all. To be now a
sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a
beast! O strange! Every inordinate cup is
unblessed and the ingredient is a devil.

53
	

II,3,1465
	

I have well approved it, sir. I drunk!

54
	

II,3,1479
	

You advise me well.

55
	

II,3,1481
	

I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I will
beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me:
I am desperate of my fortunes if they cheque me here.

56
	

III,1,1546
	

Masters, play here; I will content your pains;
Something that's brief; and bid 'Good morrow, general.'

57
	

III,1,1569
	

Dost thou hear, my honest friend?

58
	

III,1,1571
	

Prithee, keep up thy quillets. There's a poor piece
of gold for thee: if the gentlewoman that attends
the general's wife be stirring, tell her there's
one Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech:
wilt thou do this?

59
	

III,1,1578
	

Do, good my friend.
[Exit Clown]
[Enter IAGO]
In happy time, Iago.

60
	

III,1,1583
	

Why, no; the day had broke
Before we parted. I have made bold, Iago,
To send in to your wife: my suit to her
Is, that she will to virtuous Desdemona
Procure me some access.

61
	

III,1,1592
	

I humbly thank you for't.
[Exit IAGO]
I never knew
A Florentine more kind and honest.

62
	

III,1,1607
	

Yet, I beseech you,
If you think fit, or that it may be done,
Give me advantage of some brief discourse
With Desdemona alone.

63
	

III,1,1614
	

I am much bound to you.

64
	

III,3,1633
	

Bounteous madam,
Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio,
He's never any thing but your true servant.

65
	

III,3,1640
	

Ay, but, lady,
That policy may either last so long,
Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,
Or breed itself so out of circumstance,
That, I being absent and my place supplied,
My general will forget my love and service.

66
	

III,3,1657
	

Madam, I'll take my leave.

67
	

III,3,1659
	

Madam, not now: I am very ill at ease,
Unfit for mine own purposes.

68
	

III,4,2301
	

Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you
That by your virtuous means I may again
Exist, and be a member of his love
Whom I with all the office of my heart
Entirely honour: I would not be delay'd.
If my offence be of such mortal kind
That nor my service past, nor present sorrows,
Nor purposed merit in futurity,
Can ransom me into his love again,
But to know so must be my benefit;
So shall I clothe me in a forced content,
And shut myself up in some other course,
To fortune's alms.

69
	

III,4,2363
	

I humbly thank your ladyship.

70
	

III,4,2367
	

What make you from home?
How is it with you, my most fair Bianca?
I' faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house.

71
	

III,4,2375
	

Pardon me, Bianca:
I have this while with leaden thoughts been press'd:
But I shall, in a more continuate time,
Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca,
[Giving her DESDEMONA's handkerchief]
Take me this work out.

72
	

III,4,2385
	

Go to, woman!
Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth,
From whence you have them. You are jealous now
That this is from some mistress, some remembrance:
No, in good troth, Bianca.

73
	

III,4,2391
	

I know not, sweet: I found it in my chamber.
I like the work well: ere it be demanded—
As like enough it will—I'ld have it copied:
Take it, and do't; and leave me for this time.

74
	

III,4,2396
	

I do attend here on the general;
And think it no addition, nor my wish,
To have him see me woman'd.

75
	

III,4,2400
	

Not that I love you not.

76
	

III,4,2404
	

'Tis but a little way that I can bring you;
For I attend here: but I'll see you soon.

77
	

IV,1,2469
	

What's the matter?

78
	

IV,1,2472
	

Rub him about the temples.

79
	

IV,1,2533
	

The worser that you give me the addition
Whose want even kills me.

80
	

IV,1,2539
	

Alas, poor caitiff!

81
	

IV,1,2542
	

Alas, poor rogue! I think, i' faith, she loves me.

82
	

IV,1,2549
	

Ha, ha, ha!

83
	

IV,1,2551
	

I marry her! what? a customer! Prithee, bear some
charity to my wit: do not think it so unwholesome.
Ha, ha, ha!

84
	

IV,1,2556
	

Prithee, say true.

85
	

IV,1,2559
	

This is the monkey's own giving out: she is
persuaded I will marry her, out of her own love and
flattery, not out of my promise.

86
	

IV,1,2563
	

She was here even now; she haunts me in every place.
I was the other day talking on the sea-bank with
certain Venetians; and thither comes the bauble,
and, by this hand, she falls me thus about my neck—

87
	

IV,1,2569
	

So hangs, and lolls, and weeps upon me; so hales,
and pulls me: ha, ha, ha!

88
	

IV,1,2574
	

Well, I must leave her company.

89
	

IV,1,2576
	

'Tis such another fitchew! marry a perfumed one.
[Enter BIANCA]
What do you mean by this haunting of me?

90
	

IV,1,2587
	

How now, my sweet Bianca! how now! how now!

91
	

IV,1,2593
	

'Faith, I must; she'll rail in the street else.

92
	

IV,1,2595
	

'Faith, I intend so.

93
	

IV,1,2598
	

Prithee, come; will you?

94
	

V,1,3162
	

That thrust had been mine enemy indeed,
But that my coat is better than thou know'st
I will make proof of thine.

95
	

V,1,3168
	

I am maim'd for ever. Help, ho! murder! murder!

96
	

V,1,3174
	

O, help, ho! light! a surgeon!

97
	

V,1,3183
	

What, ho! no watch? no passage? murder! murder!

98
	

V,1,3185
	

O, help!

99
	

V,1,3198
	

Here, here! for heaven's sake, help me!

100
	

V,1,3203
	

Iago? O, I am spoil'd, undone by villains!
Give me some help.

101
	

V,1,3206
	

I think that one of them is hereabout,
And cannot make away.

102
	

V,1,3212
	

That's one of them.

103
	

V,1,3225
	

My leg is cut in two.

104
	

V,1,3235
	

No.

105
	

V,1,3265
	

None in the world; nor do I know the man.

106
	

V,2,3661
	

Dear general, I never gave you cause.

107
	

V,2,3677
	

Most heathenish and most gross!

108
	

V,2,3686
	

I found it in my chamber:
And he himself confess'd but even now
That there he dropp'd it for a special purpose
Which wrought to his desire.

109
	

V,2,3691
	

There is besides in Roderigo's letter,
How he upbraids Iago, that he made him
Brave me upon the watch; whereon it came
That I was cast: and even but now he spake,
After long seeming dead, Iago hurt him,
Iago set him on.

110
	

V,2,3730
	

This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon;
For he was great of heart.

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXDESDEMONAXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX	



1
	

I,3,528
	

My noble father,
I do perceive here a divided duty:
To you I am bound for life and education;
My life and education both do learn me
How to respect you; you are the lord of duty;
I am hitherto your daughter: but here's my husband,
And so much duty as my mother show'd
To you, preferring you before her father,
So much I challenge that I may profess
Due to the Moor my lord.

2
	

I,3,593
	

Nor I; I would not there reside,
To put my father in impatient thoughts
By being in his eye. Most gracious duke,
To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear;
And let me find a charter in your voice,
To assist my simpleness.

3
	

I,3,600
	

That I did love the Moor to live with him,
My downright violence and storm of fortunes
May trumpet to the world: my heart's subdued
Even to the very quality of my lord:
I saw Othello's visage in his mind,
And to his honour and his valiant parts
Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate.
So that, dear lords, if I be left behind,
A moth of peace, and he go to the war,
The rites for which I love him are bereft me,
And I a heavy interim shall support
By his dear absence. Let me go with him.

4
	

II,1,867
	

I thank you, valiant Cassio.
What tidings can you tell me of my lord?

5
	

II,1,871
	

O, but I fear—How lost you company?

6
	

II,1,889
	

Alas, she has no speech.

7
	

II,1,900
	

O, fie upon thee, slanderer!

8
	

II,1,905
	

What wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldst
praise me?

9
	

II,1,909
	

Come on assay. There's one gone to the harbour?

10
	

II,1,911
	

I am not merry; but I do beguile
The thing I am, by seeming otherwise.
Come, how wouldst thou praise me?

11
	

II,1,920
	

Well praised! How if she be black and witty?

12
	

II,1,923
	

Worse and worse.

13
	

II,1,927
	

These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i'
the alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou for
her that's foul and foolish?

14
	

II,1,932
	

O heavy ignorance! thou praisest the worst best.
But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving
woman indeed, one that, in the authority of her
merit, did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself?

15
	

II,1,947
	

To do what?

16
	

II,1,949
	

O most lame and impotent conclusion! Do not learn
of him, Emilia, though he be thy husband. How say
you, Cassio? is he not a most profane and liberal
counsellor?

17
	

II,1,969
	

Let's meet him and receive him.

18
	

II,1,973
	

My dear Othello!

19
	

II,1,985
	

The heavens forbid
But that our loves and comforts should increase,
Even as our days do grow!

20
	

II,3,1403
	

What's the matter?

21
	

III,3,1626
	

Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do
All my abilities in thy behalf.

22
	

III,3,1630
	

O, that's an honest fellow. Do not doubt, Cassio,
But I will have my lord and you again
As friendly as you were.

23
	

III,3,1636
	

I know't; I thank you. You do love my lord:
You have known him long; and be you well assured
He shall in strangeness stand no further off
Than in a polite distance.

24
	

III,3,1646
	

Do not doubt that; before Emilia here
I give thee warrant of thy place: assure thee,
If I do vow a friendship, I'll perform it
To the last article: my lord shall never rest;
I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;
His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;
I'll intermingle every thing he does
With Cassio's suit: therefore be merry, Cassio;
For thy solicitor shall rather die
Than give thy cause away.

25
	

III,3,1658
	

Why, stay, and hear me speak.

26
	

III,3,1661
	

Well, do your discretion.

27
	

III,3,1672
	

How now, my lord!
I have been talking with a suitor here,
A man that languishes in your displeasure.

28
	

III,3,1676
	

Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,
If I have any grace or power to move you,
His present reconciliation take;
For if he be not one that truly loves you,
That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,
I have no judgment in an honest face:
I prithee, call him back.

29
	

III,3,1684
	

Ay, sooth; so humbled
That he hath left part of his grief with me,
To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.

30
	

III,3,1688
	

But shall't be shortly?

31
	

III,3,1690
	

Shall't be to-night at supper?

32
	

III,3,1692
	

To-morrow dinner, then?

33
	

III,3,1695
	

Why, then, to-morrow night; or Tuesday morn;
On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn:
I prithee, name the time, but let it not
Exceed three days: in faith, he's penitent;
And yet his trespass, in our common reason—
Save that, they say, the wars must make examples
Out of their best—is not almost a fault
To incur a private cheque. When shall he come?
Tell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul,
What you would ask me, that I should deny,
Or stand so mammering on. What! Michael Cassio,
That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,
When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,
Hath ta'en your part; to have so much to do
To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much,—

34
	

III,3,1712
	

Why, this is not a boon;
'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,
Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,
Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit
To your own person: nay, when I have a suit
Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,
It shall be full of poise and difficult weight
And fearful to be granted.

35
	

III,3,1723
	

Shall I deny you? no: farewell, my lord.

36
	

III,3,1725
	

Emilia, come. Be as your fancies teach you;
Whate'er you be, I am obedient.

37
	

III,3,1942
	

How now, my dear Othello!
Your dinner, and the generous islanders
By you invited, do attend your presence.

38
	

III,3,1946
	

Why do you speak so faintly?
Are you not well?

39
	

III,3,1949
	

'Faith, that's with watching; 'twill away again:
Let me but bind it hard, within this hour
It will be well.

40
	

III,3,1955
	

I am very sorry that you are not well.

41
	

III,4,2174
	

Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?

42
	

III,4,2176
	

Why, man?

43
	

III,4,2179
	

Go to: where lodges he?

44
	

III,4,2181
	

Can any thing be made of this?

45
	

III,4,2185
	

Can you inquire him out, and be edified by report?

46
	

III,4,2188
	

Seek him, bid him come hither: tell him I have
moved my lord on his behalf, and hope all will be well.

47
	

III,4,2193
	

Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?

48
	

III,4,2195
	

Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse
Full of crusadoes: and, but my noble Moor
Is true of mind and made of no such baseness
As jealous creatures are, it were enough
To put him to ill thinking.

49
	

III,4,2201
	

Who, he? I think the sun where he was born
Drew all such humours from him.

50
	

III,4,2204
	

I will not leave him now till Cassio
Be call'd to him.
[Enter OTHELLO]
How is't with you, my lord

51
	

III,4,2212
	

Well, my good lord.

52
	

III,4,2214
	

It yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow.

53
	

III,4,2222
	

You may, indeed, say so;
For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.

54
	

III,4,2226
	

I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.

55
	

III,4,2228
	

I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.

56
	

III,4,2231
	

Here, my lord.

57
	

III,4,2233
	

I have it not about me.

58
	

III,4,2235
	

No, indeed, my lord.

59
	

III,4,2252
	

Is't possible?

60
	

III,4,2260
	

Indeed! is't true?

61
	

III,4,2262
	

Then would to God that I had never seen't!

62
	

III,4,2264
	

Why do you speak so startingly and rash?

63
	

III,4,2267
	

Heaven bless us!

64
	

III,4,2269
	

It is not lost; but what an if it were?

65
	

III,4,2271
	

I say, it is not lost.

66
	

III,4,2273
	

Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now.
This is a trick to put me from my suit:
Pray you, let Cassio be received again.

67
	

III,4,2277
	

Come, come;
You'll never meet a more sufficient man.

68
	

III,4,2280
	

I pray, talk me of Cassio.

69
	

III,4,2282
	

A man that all his time
Hath founded his good fortunes on your love,
Shared dangers with you,—

70
	

III,4,2286
	

In sooth, you are to blame.

71
	

III,4,2290
	

I ne'er saw this before.
Sure, there's some wonder in this handkerchief:
I am most unhappy in the loss of it.

72
	

III,4,2300
	

How now, good Cassio! what's the news with you?

73
	

III,4,2314
	

Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio!
My advocation is not now in tune;
My lord is not my lord; nor should I know him,
Were he in favour as in humour alter'd.
So help me every spirit sanctified,
As I have spoken for you all my best
And stood within the blank of his displeasure
For my free speech! you must awhile be patient:
What I can do I will; and more I will
Than for myself I dare: let that suffice you.

74
	

III,4,2333
	

I prithee, do so.
[Exit IAGO]
Something, sure, of state,
Either from Venice, or some unhatch'd practise
Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,
Hath puddled his clear spirit: and in such cases
Men's natures wrangle with inferior things,
Though great ones are their object. 'Tis even so;
For let our finger ache, and it indues
Our other healthful members even to that sense
Of pain: nay, we must think men are not gods,
Nor of them look for such observances
As fit the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,
I was, unhandsome warrior as I am,
Arraigning his unkindness with my soul;
But now I find I had suborn'd the witness,
And he's indicted falsely.

75
	

III,4,2353
	

Alas the day! I never gave him cause.

76
	

III,4,2358
	

Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind!

77
	

III,4,2360
	

I will go seek him. Cassio, walk hereabout:
If I do find him fit, I'll move your suit
And seek to effect it to my uttermost.

78
	

IV,1,2655
	

And what's the news, good cousin Lodovico?

79
	

IV,1,2660
	

Cousin, there's fall'n between him and my lord
An unkind breach: but you shall make all well.

80
	

IV,1,2663
	

My lord?

81
	

IV,1,2667
	

A most unhappy one: I would do much
To atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio.

82
	

IV,1,2670
	

My lord?

83
	

IV,1,2672
	

What, is he angry?

84
	

IV,1,2676
	

Trust me, I am glad on't.

85
	

IV,1,2678
	

My lord?

86
	

IV,1,2680
	

Why, sweet Othello,—

87
	

IV,1,2682
	

I have not deserved this.

88
	

IV,1,2690
	

I will not stay to offend you.

89
	

IV,1,2695
	

My lord?

90
	

IV,2,2764
	

My lord, what is your will?

91
	

IV,2,2766
	

What is your pleasure?

92
	

IV,2,2769
	

What horrible fancy's this?

93
	

IV,2,2775
	

Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?
I understand a fury in your words.
But not the words.

94
	

IV,2,2779
	

Your wife, my lord; your true
And loyal wife.

95
	

IV,2,2785
	

Heaven doth truly know it.

96
	

IV,2,2787
	

To whom, my lord? with whom? how am I false?

97
	

IV,2,2789
	

Alas the heavy day! Why do you weep?
Am I the motive of these tears, my lord?
If haply you my father do suspect
An instrument of this your calling back,
Lay not your blame on me: If you have lost him,
Why, I have lost him too.

98
	

IV,2,2813
	

I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.

99
	

IV,2,2819
	

Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed?

100
	

IV,2,2831
	

By heaven, you do me wrong.

101
	

IV,2,2833
	

No, as I am a Christian:
If to preserve this vessel for my lord
From any other foul unlawful touch
Be not to be a strumpet, I am none.

102
	

IV,2,2838
	

No, as I shall be saved.

103
	

IV,2,2840
	

O, heaven forgive us!

104
	

IV,2,2855
	

'Faith, half asleep.

105
	

IV,2,2857
	

With who?

106
	

IV,2,2859
	

Who is thy lord?

107
	

IV,2,2861
	

I have none: do not talk to me, Emilia;
I cannot weep; nor answer have I none,
But what should go by water. Prithee, tonight
Lay on my bed my wedding sheets: remember;
And call thy husband hither.

108
	

IV,2,2868
	

'Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.
How have I been behaved, that he might stick
The small'st opinion on my least misuse?

109
	

IV,2,2874
	

I cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes
Do it with gentle means and easy tasks:
He might have chid me so; for, in good faith,
I am a child to chiding.

110
	

IV,2,2882
	

Am I that name, Iago?

111
	

IV,2,2884
	

Such as she says my lord did say I was.

112
	

IV,2,2888
	

I do not know; I am sure I am none such.

113
	

IV,2,2893
	

It is my wretched fortune.

114
	

IV,2,2896
	

Nay, heaven doth know.

115
	

IV,2,2902
	

If any such there be, heaven pardon him!

116
	

IV,2,2917
	

O good Iago,
What shall I do to win my lord again?
Good friend, go to him; for, by this light of heaven,
I know not how I lost him. Here I kneel:
If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love,
Either in discourse of thought or actual deed,
Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,
Delighted them in any other form;
Or that I do not yet, and ever did.
And ever will—though he do shake me off
To beggarly divorcement—love him dearly,
Comfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much;
And his unkindness may defeat my life,
But never taint my love. I cannot say 'whore:'
It does abhor me now I speak the word;
To do the act that might the addition earn
Not the world's mass of vanity could make me.

117
	

IV,2,2937
	

If 'twere no other—

118
	

IV,3,3022
	

Your honour is most welcome.

119
	

IV,3,3025
	

My lord?

120
	

IV,3,3028
	

I will, my lord.

121
	

IV,3,3031
	

He says he will return incontinent:
He hath commanded me to go to bed,
And bade me to dismiss you.

122
	

IV,3,3035
	

It was his bidding: therefore, good Emilia,.
Give me my nightly wearing, and adieu:
We must not now displease him.

123
	

IV,3,3039
	

So would not I. my love doth so approve him,
That even his stubbornness, his cheques, his frowns—
Prithee, unpin me,—have grace and favour in them.

124
	

IV,3,3043
	

All's one. Good faith, how foolish are our minds!
If I do die before thee prithee, shroud me
In one of those same sheets.

125
	

IV,3,3047
	

My mother had a maid call'd Barbara:
She was in love, and he she loved proved mad
And did forsake her: she had a song of 'willow;'
An old thing 'twas, but it express'd her fortune,
And she died singing it: that song to-night
Will not go from my mind; I have much to do,
But to go hang my head all at one side,
And sing it like poor Barbara. Prithee, dispatch.

126
	

IV,3,3056
	

No, unpin me here.
This Lodovico is a proper man.

127
	

IV,3,3059
	

He speaks well.

128
	

IV,3,3062
	

[Singing] The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree,
Sing all a green willow:
Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee,
Sing willow, willow, willow:
The fresh streams ran by her, and murmur'd her moans;
Sing willow, willow, willow;
Her salt tears fell from her, and soften'd the stones;
Lay by these:—
[Singing]
Sing willow, willow, willow;
Prithee, hie thee; he'll come anon:—
[Singing]
Sing all a green willow must be my garland.
Let nobody blame him; his scorn I approve,-
Nay, that's not next.—Hark! who is't that knocks?

129
	

IV,3,3078
	

[Singing] I call'd my love false love; but what
said he then?
Sing willow, willow, willow:
If I court moe women, you'll couch with moe men!
So, get thee gone; good night Ate eyes do itch;
Doth that bode weeping?

130
	

IV,3,3085
	

I have heard it said so. O, these men, these men!
Dost thou in conscience think,—tell me, Emilia,—
That there be women do abuse their husbands
In such gross kind?

131
	

IV,3,3090
	

Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?

132
	

IV,3,3092
	

No, by this heavenly light!

133
	

IV,3,3095
	

Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?

134
	

IV,3,3098
	

In troth, I think thou wouldst not.

135
	

IV,3,3106
	

Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong
For the whole world.

136
	

IV,3,3111
	

I do not think there is any such woman.

137
	

IV,3,3132
	

Good night, good night: heaven me such uses send,
Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend!

138
	

V,2,3325
	

Who's there? Othello?

139
	

V,2,3327
	

Will you come to bed, my lord?

140
	

V,2,3329
	

Ay, my lord.

141
	

V,2,3333
	

Alas, my lord, what do you mean by that?

142
	

V,2,3337
	

Talk you of killing?

143
	

V,2,3339
	

Then heaven
Have mercy on me!

144
	

V,2,3342
	

If you say so, I hope you will not kill me.

145
	

V,2,3344
	

And yet I fear you; for you are fatal then
When your eyes roll so: why I should fear I know not,
Since guiltiness I know not; but yet I feel I fear.

146
	

V,2,3348
	

They are loves I bear to you.

147
	

V,2,3350
	

That death's unnatural that kills for loving.
Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?
Some bloody passion shakes your very frame:
These are portents; but yet I hope, I hope,
They do not point on me.

148
	

V,2,3356
	

I will so. What's the matter?

149
	

V,2,3359
	

No, by my life and soul!
Send for the man, and ask him.

150
	

V,2,3363
	

Ay, but not yet to die.

151
	

V,2,3369
	

Then Lord have mercy on me!

152
	

V,2,3371
	

And have you mercy too! I never did
Offend you in my life; never loved Cassio
But with such general warranty of heaven
As I might love: I never gave him token.

153
	

V,2,3380
	

He found it then;
I never gave it him: send for him hither;
Let him confess a truth.

154
	

V,2,3384
	

What, my lord?

155
	

V,2,3386
	

How? unlawfully?

156
	

V,2,3388
	

He will not say so.

157
	

V,2,3391
	

O! my fear interprets: what, is he dead?

158
	

V,2,3394
	

Alas! he is betray'd and I undone.

159
	

V,2,3396
	

O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!

160
	

V,2,3398
	

Kill me to-morrow: let me live to-night!

161
	

V,2,3400
	

But half an hour!

162
	

V,2,3402
	

But while I say one prayer!

163
	

V,2,3444
	

O, falsely, falsely murder'd!

164
	

V,2,3450
	

A guiltless death I die.

165
	

V,2,3452
	

Nobody; I myself. Farewell
Commend me to my kind lord: O, farewell!

II,1,895
	

You have little cause to say so.

2
	

II,1,903
	

You shall not write my praise.

3
	

II,1,924
	

How if fair and foolish?

4
	

III,1,1597
	

Good morrow, good Lieutenant: I am sorry
For your displeasure; but all will sure be well.
The general and his wife are talking of it;
And she speaks for you stoutly: the Moor replies,
That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus,
And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom
He might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you
And needs no other suitor but his likings
To take the safest occasion by the front
To bring you in again.

5
	

III,1,1611
	

Pray you, come in;
I will bestow you where you shall have time
To speak your bosom freely.

6
	

III,3,1628
	

Good madam, do: I warrant it grieves my husband,
As if the case were his.

7
	

III,3,1656
	

Madam, here comes my lord.

8
	

III,3,1957
	

I am glad I have found this napkin:
This was her first remembrance from the Moor:
My wayward husband hath a hundred times
Woo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token,
For he conjured her she should ever keep it,
That she reserves it evermore about her
To kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out,
And give't Iago: what he will do with it
Heaven knows, not I;
I nothing but to please his fantasy.

9
	

III,3,1969
	

Do not you chide; I have a thing for you.

10
	

III,3,1971
	

Ha!

11
	

III,3,1973
	

O, is that all? What will you give me now
For the same handkerchief?

12
	

III,3,1976
	

What handkerchief?
Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona;
That which so often you did bid me steal.

13
	

III,3,1980
	

No, 'faith; she let it drop by negligence.
And, to the advantage, I, being here, took't up.
Look, here it is.

14
	

III,3,1984
	

What will you do with 't, that you have been
so earnest
To have me filch it?

15
	

III,3,1988
	

If it be not for some purpose of import,
Give't me again: poor lady, she'll run mad
When she shall lack it.

16
	

III,4,2194
	

I know not, madam.

17
	

III,4,2200
	

Is he not jealous?

18
	

III,4,2203
	

Look, where he comes.

19
	

III,4,2289
	

Is not this man jealous?

20
	

III,4,2293
	

'Tis not a year or two shows us a man:
They are all but stomachs, and we all but food;
To eat us hungerly, and when they are full,
They belch us. Look you, Cassio and my husband!

21
	

III,4,2325
	

He went hence but now,
And certainly in strange unquietness.

22
	

III,4,2350
	

Pray heaven it be state-matters, as you think,
And no conception nor no jealous toy
Concerning you.

23
	

III,4,2354
	

But jealous souls will not be answer'd so;
They are not ever jealous for the cause,
But jealous for they are jealous: 'tis a monster
Begot upon itself, born on itself.

24
	

III,4,2359
	

Lady, amen.

25
	

IV,2,2738
	

Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.

26
	

IV,2,2740
	

But then I saw no harm, and then I heard
Each syllable that breath made up between them.

27
	

IV,2,2743
	

Never, my lord.

28
	

IV,2,2745
	

Never.

29
	

IV,2,2747
	

Never, my lord.

30
	

IV,2,2749
	

I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest,
Lay down my soul at stake: if you think other,
Remove your thought; it doth abuse your bosom.
If any wretch have put this in your head,
Let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse!
For, if she be not honest, chaste, and true,
There's no man happy; the purest of their wives
Is foul as slander.

31
	

IV,2,2853
	

Alas, what does this gentleman conceive?
How do you, madam? how do you, my good lady?

32
	

IV,2,2856
	

Good madam, what's the matter with my lord?

33
	

IV,2,2858
	

Why, with my lord, madam.

34
	

IV,2,2860
	

He that is yours, sweet lady.

35
	

IV,2,2866
	

Here's a change indeed!

36
	

IV,2,2879
	

Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her.
Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her,
As true hearts cannot bear.

37
	

IV,2,2885
	

He call'd her whore: a beggar in his drink
Could not have laid such terms upon his callat.

38
	

IV,2,2890
	

Hath she forsook so many noble matches,
Her father and her country and her friends,
To be call'd whore? would it not make one weep?

39
	

IV,2,2897
	

I will be hang'd, if some eternal villain,
Some busy and insinuating rogue,
Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office,
Have not devised this slander; I'll be hang'd else.

40
	

IV,2,2903
	

A halter pardon him! and hell gnaw his bones!
Why should he call her whore? who keeps her company?
What place? what time? what form? what likelihood?
The Moor's abused by some most villanous knave,
Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.
O heaven, that such companions thou'ldst unfold,
And put in every honest hand a whip
To lash the rascals naked through the world
Even from the east to the west!

41
	

IV,2,2913
	

O, fie upon them! Some such squire he was
That turn'd your wit the seamy side without,
And made you to suspect me with the Moor.

42
	

IV,3,3030
	

How goes it now? he looks gentler than he did.

43
	

IV,3,3034
	

Dismiss me!

44
	

IV,3,3038
	

I would you had never seen him!

45
	

IV,3,3042
	

I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.

46
	

IV,3,3046
	

Come, come you talk.

47
	

IV,3,3055
	

Shall I go fetch your night-gown?

48
	

IV,3,3058
	

A very handsome man.

49
	

IV,3,3060
	

I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot
to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.

50
	

IV,3,3077
	

It's the wind.

51
	

IV,3,3084
	

'Tis neither here nor there.

52
	

IV,3,3089
	

There be some such, no question.

53
	

IV,3,3091
	

Why, would not you?

54
	

IV,3,3093
	

Nor I neither by this heavenly light;
I might do't as well i' the dark.

55
	

IV,3,3096
	

The world's a huge thing: it is a great price.
For a small vice.

56
	

IV,3,3099
	

In troth, I think I should; and undo't when I had
done. Marry, I would not do such a thing for a
joint-ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for
gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty
exhibition; but for the whole world,—why, who would
not make her husband a cuckold to make him a
monarch? I should venture purgatory for't.

57
	

IV,3,3108
	

Why the wrong is but a wrong i' the world: and
having the world for your labour, tis a wrong in your
own world, and you might quickly make it right.

58
	

IV,3,3112
	

Yes, a dozen; and as many to the vantage as would
store the world they played for.
But I do think it is their husbands' faults
If wives do fall: say that they slack their duties,
And pour our treasures into foreign laps,
Or else break out in peevish jealousies,
Throwing restraint upon us; or say they strike us,
Or scant our former having in despite;
Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,
Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know
Their wives have sense like them: they see and smell
And have their palates both for sweet and sour,
As husbands have. What is it that they do
When they change us for others? Is it sport?
I think it is: and doth affection breed it?
I think it doth: is't frailty that thus errs?
It is so too: and have not we affections,
Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?
Then let them use us well: else let them know,
The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.

59
	

V,1,3276
	

'Las, what's the matter? what's the matter, husband?

60
	

V,1,3280
	

Alas, good gentleman! alas, good Cassio!

61
	

V,1,3287
	

Fie, fie upon thee, strumpet!

62
	

V,1,3290
	

As I! foh! fie upon thee!

63
	

V,2,3405
	

[Within] My lord, my lord! what, ho! my lord, my lord!

64
	

V,2,3409
	

[Within] What, ho! my lord, my lord!

65
	

V,2,3411
	

[Within] O, good my lord, I would speak a word with you!

66
	

V,2,3423
	

[Within] I do beseech you
That I may speak with you, O, good my lord!

67
	

V,2,3431
	

O, my good lord, yonder's foul murders done!

68
	

V,2,3433
	

But now, my lord.

69
	

V,2,3437
	

Cassio, my lord, hath kill'd a young Venetian
Call'd Roderigo.

70
	

V,2,3441
	

No, Cassio is not kill'd.

71
	

V,2,3445
	

Alas, what cry is that?

72
	

V,2,3447
	

Out, and alas! that was my lady's voice.
Help! help, ho! help! O lady, speak again!
Sweet Desdemona! O sweet mistress, speak!

73
	

V,2,3451
	

O, who hath done this deed?

74
	

V,2,3456
	

Alas, who knows?

75
	

V,2,3458
	

She said so: I must needs report the truth.

76
	

V,2,3461
	

O, the more angel she,
And you the blacker devil!

77
	

V,2,3464
	

Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil.

78
	

V,2,3466
	

Thou art rash as fire, to say
That she was false: O, she was heavenly true!

79
	

V,2,3472
	

My husband!

80
	

V,2,3474
	

That she was false to wedlock?

81
	

V,2,3479
	

My husband!

82
	

V,2,3483
	

My husband!

83
	

V,2,3485
	

O mistress, villany hath made mocks with love,
My husband say that she was false!

84
	

V,2,3490
	

If he say so, may his pernicious soul
Rot half a grain a day! he lies to the heart:
She was too fond of her most filthy bargain.

85
	

V,2,3494
	

Do thy worst:
This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven
Than thou wast worthy her.

86
	

V,2,3498
	

Thou hast not half that power to do me harm
As I have to be hurt. O gull! O dolt!
As ignorant as dirt! thou hast done a deed—
I care not for thy sword; I'll make thee known,
Though I lost twenty lives.—Help! help, ho! help!
The Moor hath kill'd my mistress! Murder! murder!

87
	

V,2,3506
	

O, are you come, Iago? you have done well,
That men must lay their murders on your neck.

88
	

V,2,3509
	

Disprove this villain, if thou be'st a man:
He says thou told'st him that his wife was false:
I know thou didst not, thou'rt not such a villain:
Speak, for my heart is full.

89
	

V,2,3515
	

But did you ever tell him she was false?

90
	

V,2,3517
	

You told a lie, an odious, damned lie;
Upon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie.
She false with Cassio!—did you say with Cassio?

91
	

V,2,3521
	

I will not charm my tongue; I am bound to speak:
My mistress here lies murder'd in her bed,—

92
	

V,2,3524
	

And your reports have set the murder on.

93
	

V,2,3528
	

Villany, villany, villany!
I think upon't, I think: I smell't: O villany!—
I thought so then:—I'll kill myself for grief:—
O villany, villany!

94
	

V,2,3533
	

Good gentlemen, let me have leave to speak:
'Tis proper I obey him, but not now.
Perchance, Iago, I will ne'er go home.

95
	

V,2,3538
	

Nay, lay thee down and roar;
For thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent
That e'er did lift up eye.

96
	

V,2,3559
	

O heaven! O heavenly powers!

97
	

V,2,3561
	

'Twill out, 'twill out: I peace!
No, I will speak as liberal as the north:
Let heaven and men and devils, let them all,
All, all, cry shame against me, yet I'll speak.

98
	

V,2,3566
	

I will not.

99
	

V,2,3570
	

O thou dull Moor! that handkerchief thou speak'st of
I found by fortune and did give my husband;
For often, with a solemn earnestness,
More than indeed belong'd to such a trifle,
He begg'd of me to steal it.

100
	

V,2,3576
	

She give it Cassio! no, alas! I found it,
And I did give't my husband.

101
	

V,2,3579
	

By heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen.
O murderous coxcomb! what should such a fool
Do with so good a woman?

102
	

V,2,3586
	

Ay, ay: O, lay me by my mistress' side.

103
	

V,2,3598
	

What did thy song bode, lady?
Hark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan.
And die in music.
[Singing]
Willow, willow, willow,—
Moor, she was chaste; she loved thee, cruel Moor;
So come my soul to bliss, as I speak true;
So speaking as I think, I die, I die.
