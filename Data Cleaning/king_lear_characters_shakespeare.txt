I,1,55
	

Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter;
Dearer than eyesight, space, and liberty;
Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare;
No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;
As much as child e'er lov'd, or father found;
A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable.
Beyond all manner of so much I love you.

2
	

I,1,300
	

Prescribe not us our duties.

3
	

I,1,310
	

Sister, it is not little I have to say of what most nearly
appertains to us both. I think our father will hence to-night.

4
	

I,1,313
	

You see how full of changes his age is. The observation we
have made of it hath not been little. He always lov'd our
sister most, and with what poor judgment he hath now cast her
off appears too grossly.

5
	

I,1,319
	

The best and soundest of his time hath been but rash; then
must we look to receive from his age, not alone the
imperfections of long-ingraffed condition, but therewithal
the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring with
them.

6
	

I,1,326
	

There is further compliment of leave-taking between France and
him. Pray you let's hit together. If our father carry authority
with such dispositions as he bears, this last surrender of his
will but offend us.

7
	

I,1,331
	

We must do something, and i' th' heat.

8
	

I,3,505
	

Did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool?

9
	

I,3,507
	

By day and night, he wrongs me! Every hour
He flashes into one gross crime or other
That sets us all at odds. I'll not endure it.
His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us
On every trifle. When he returns from hunting,
I will not speak with him. Say I am sick.
If you come slack of former services,
You shall do well; the fault of it I'll answer.

10
	

I,3,517
	

Put on what weary negligence you please,
You and your fellows. I'd have it come to question.
If he distaste it, let him to our sister,
Whose mind and mine I know in that are one,
Not to be overrul'd. Idle old man,
That still would manage those authorities
That he hath given away! Now, by my life,
Old fools are babes again, and must be us'd
With checks as flatteries, when they are seen abus'd.
Remember what I have said.

11
	

I,3,528
	

And let his knights have colder looks among you.
What grows of it, no matter. Advise your fellows so.
I would breed from hence occasions, and I shall,
That I may speak. I'll write straight to my sister
To hold my very course. Prepare for dinner.

12
	

I,4,722
	

Not only, sir, this your all-licens'd fool,
But other of your insolent retinue
Do hourly carp and quarrel, breaking forth
In rank and not-to-be-endured riots. Sir,
I had thought, by making this well known unto you,
To have found a safe redress, but now grow fearful,
By what yourself, too, late have spoke and done,
That you protect this course, and put it on
By your allowance; which if you should, the fault
Would not scape censure, nor the redresses sleep,
Which, in the tender of a wholesome weal,
Might in their working do you that offence
Which else were shame, that then necessity
Must call discreet proceeding.

13
	

I,4,741
	

Come, sir,
I would you would make use of that good wisdom
Whereof I know you are fraught, and put away
These dispositions that of late transform you
From what you rightly are.

14
	

I,4,759
	

This admiration, sir, is much o' th' savour
Of other your new pranks. I do beseech you
To understand my purposes aright.
As you are old and reverend, you should be wise.
Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires;
Men so disorder'd, so debosh'd, and bold
That this our court, infected with their manners,
Shows like a riotous inn. Epicurism and lust
Make it more like a tavern or a brothel
Than a grac'd palace. The shame itself doth speak
For instant remedy. Be then desir'd
By her that else will take the thing she begs
A little to disquantity your train,
And the remainder that shall still depend
To be such men as may besort your age,
Which know themselves, and you.

15
	

I,4,779
	

You strike my people, and your disorder'd rabble
Make servants of their betters.

16
	

I,4,818
	

Never afflict yourself to know the cause;
But let his disposition have that scope
That dotage gives it.

17
	

I,4,841
	

Do you mark that, my lord?

18
	

I,4,844
	

Pray you, content.- What, Oswald, ho!
[To the Fool] You, sir, more knave than fool, after your master!

19
	

I,4,852
	

This man hath had good counsel! A hundred knights?
'Tis politic and safe to let him keep
At point a hundred knights; yes, that on every dream,
Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,
He may enguard his dotage with their pow'rs
And hold our lives in mercy.- Oswald, I say!

20
	

I,4,859
	

Safer than trust too far.
Let me still take away the harms I fear,
Not fear still to be taken. I know his heart.
What he hath utter'd I have writ my sister.
If she sustain him and his hundred knights,
When I have show'd th' unfitness- [Enter [Oswald the] Steward.]
How now, Oswald?
What, have you writ that letter to my sister?

21
	

I,4,868
	

Take you some company, and away to horse!
Inform her full of my particular fear,
And thereto add such reasons of your own
As may compact it more. Get you gone,
And hasten your return. [Exit Oswald.] No, no, my lord!
This milky gentleness and course of yours,
Though I condemn it not, yet, under pardon,
You are much more at task for want of wisdom
Than prais'd for harmful mildness.

22
	

I,4,879
	

Nay then-

23
	

II,4,1488
	

Why not by th' hand, sir? How have I offended?
All's not offence that indiscretion finds
And dotage terms so.

24
	

II,4,1513
	

At your choice, sir.

25
	

II,4,1541
	

Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance
From those that she calls servants, or from mine?

26
	

II,4,1560
	

Hear, me, my lord.
What need you five-and-twenty, ten, or five,
To follow in a house where twice so many
Have a command to tend you?

27
	

II,4,1592
	

'Tis his own blame; hath put himself from rest
And must needs taste his folly.

28
	

II,4,1596
	

So am I purpos'd.
Where is my Lord of Gloucester?

29
	

II,4,1605
	

My lord, entreat him by no means to stay.

30
	

III,7,2126
	

Pluck out his eyes.

31
	

III,7,2141
	

Farewell, sweet lord, and sister.

32
	

IV,2,2338
	

Welcome, my lord. I marvel our mild husband
Not met us on the way. [Enter Oswald the Steward.]
Now, where's your master?

33
	

IV,2,2350
	

[to Edmund] Then shall you go no further.
It is the cowish terror of his spirit,
That dares not undertake. He'll not feel wrongs
Which tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way
May prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother.
Hasten his musters and conduct his pow'rs.
I must change arms at home and give the distaff
Into my husband's hands. This trusty servant
Shall pass between us. Ere long you are like to hear
(If you dare venture in your own behalf)
A mistress's command. Wear this. [Gives a favour.]
Spare speech.
Decline your head. This kiss, if it durst speak,
Would stretch thy spirits up into the air.
Conceive, and fare thee well.

34
	

IV,2,2366
	

My most dear Gloucester!
O, the difference of man and man!
To thee a woman's services are due;
My fool usurps my body.

35
	

IV,2,2372
	

I have been worth the whistle.

36
	

IV,2,2381
	

No more! The text is foolish.

37
	

IV,2,2395
	

Milk-liver'd man!
That bear'st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs;
Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning
Thine honour from thy suffering; that not know'st
Fools do those villains pity who are punish'd
Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
France spreads his banners in our noiseless land,
With plumed helm thy state begins to threat,
Whiles thou, a moral fool, sit'st still, and criest
'Alack, why does he so?'

38
	

IV,2,2408
	

O vain fool!

39
	

IV,2,2415
	

Marry, your manhood mew!

40
	

IV,2,2435
	

[aside] One way I like this well;
But being widow, and my Gloucester with her,
May all the building in my fancy pluck
Upon my hateful life. Another way
The news is not so tart.- I'll read, and answer. Exit.

41
	

V,1,3045
	

[aside] I had rather lose the battle than that sister
Should loosen him and me.

42
	

V,1,3057
	

Combine together 'gainst the enemy;
For these domestic and particular broils
Are not the question here.

43
	

V,1,3064
	

No.

44
	

V,1,3066
	

[aside] O, ho, I know the riddle.- I will go.
[As they are going out,] enter Edgar [disguised].

45
	

V,3,3197
	

Not so hot!
In his own grace he doth exalt himself
More than in your addition.

46
	

V,3,3202
	

That were the most if he should husband you.

47
	

V,3,3204
	

Holla, holla!
That eye that told you so look'd but asquint.

48
	

V,3,3212
	

Mean you to enjoy him?

49
	

V,3,3226
	

An interlude!

50
	

V,3,3235
	

[aside] If not, I'll ne'er trust medicine.

51
	

V,3,3302
	

This is mere practice, Gloucester.
By th' law of arms thou wast not bound to answer
An unknown opposite. Thou art not vanquish'd,
But cozen'd and beguil'd.

52
	

V,3,3311
	

Say if I do- the laws are mine, not thine.
Who can arraign me for't?

53
	

V,3,3315
	

Ask me not what I know. Exit.

1
	

I,1,23
	

[comes forward] No, my lord.

2
	

I,1,26
	

My services to your lordship.

3
	

I,1,28
	

Sir, I shall study deserving.

4
	

I,2,334
	

Thou, Nature, art my goddess; to thy law
My services are bound. Wherefore should I
Stand in the plague of custom, and permit
The curiosity of nations to deprive me,
For that I am some twelve or fourteen moonshines
Lag of a brother? Why bastard? wherefore base?
When my dimensions are as well compact,
My mind as generous, and my shape as true,
As honest madam's issue? Why brand they us
With base? with baseness? bastardy? base, base?
Who, in the lusty stealth of nature, take
More composition and fierce quality
Than doth, within a dull, stale, tired bed,
Go to th' creating a whole tribe of fops
Got 'tween asleep and wake? Well then,
Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land.
Our father's love is to the bastard Edmund
As to th' legitimate. Fine word- 'legitimate'!
Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed,
And my invention thrive, Edmund the base
Shall top th' legitimate. I grow; I prosper.
Now, gods, stand up for bastards!

5
	

I,2,361
	

So please your lordship, none.

6
	

I,2,364
	

I know no news, my lord.

7
	

I,2,366
	

Nothing, my lord.

8
	

I,2,371
	

I beseech you, sir, pardon me. It is a letter from my brother
that I have not all o'er-read; and for so much as I have
perus'd, I find it not fit for your o'erlooking.

9
	

I,2,375
	

I shall offend, either to detain or give it. The contents, as
in part I understand them, are to blame.

10
	

I,2,378
	

I hope, for my brother's justification, he wrote this but as
an essay or taste of my virtue.

11
	

I,2,392
	

It was not brought me, my lord: there's the cunning of it. I
found it thrown in at the casement of my closet.

12
	

I,2,395
	

If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear it were his;
but in respect of that, I would fain think it were not.

13
	

I,2,398
	

It is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart is not in the
contents.

14
	

I,2,401
	

Never, my lord. But I have heard him oft maintain it to be fit
that, sons at perfect age, and fathers declining, the father
should be as ward to the son, and the son manage his revenue.

15
	

I,2,408
	

I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please you to suspend
your indignation against my brother till you can derive from him
better testimony of his intent, you should run a certain course;
where, if you violently proceed against him, mistaking his
purpose, it would make a great gap in your own honour and shake
in pieces the heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my life
for him that he hath writ this to feel my affection to your
honour, and to no other pretence of danger.

16
	

I,2,417
	

If your honour judge it meet, I will place you where you shall
hear us confer of this and by an auricular assurance have your
satisfaction, and that without any further delay than this very
evening.

17
	

I,2,422
	

Nor is not, sure.

18
	

I,2,427
	

I will seek him, sir, presently; convey the business as I
shall find means, and acquaint you withal.

19
	

I,2,442
	

This is the excellent foppery of the world, that, when we are
sick in fortune, often the surfeit of our own behaviour, we make
guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars; as if
we were villains on necessity; fools by heavenly compulsion;
knaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical pre-dominance;
drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforc'd obedience of
planetary influence; and all that we are evil in, by a divine
thrusting on. An admirable evasion of whore-master man, to lay
his goatish disposition to the charge of a star! My father
compounded with my mother under the Dragon's Tail, and my
nativity was under Ursa Major, so that it follows I am rough and
lecherous. Fut! I should have been that I am, had the
maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on my bastardizing.
Edgar-
[Enter Edgar.]
and pat! he comes, like the catastrophe of the old comedy. My
cue is villainous melancholy, with a sigh like Tom o' Bedlam.
O, these eclipses do portend these divisions! Fa, sol, la, mi.

20
	

I,2,462
	

I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read this other day,
what should follow these eclipses.

21
	

I,2,465
	

I promise you, the effects he writes of succeed unhappily: as
of unnaturalness between the child and the parent; death,
dearth, dissolutions of ancient amities; divisions in state,
menaces and maledictions against king and nobles; needless
diffidences, banishment of friends, dissipation of cohorts,
nuptial breaches, and I know not what.

22
	

I,2,472
	

Come, come! When saw you my father last?

23
	

I,2,474
	

Spake you with him?

24
	

I,2,476
	

Parted you in good terms? Found you no displeasure in him by
word or countenance

25
	

I,2,479
	

Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended him; and at my
entreaty forbear his presence until some little time hath
qualified the heat of his displeasure, which at this instant so
rageth in him that with the mischief of your person it would
scarcely allay.

26
	

I,2,485
	

That's my fear. I pray you have a continent forbearance till
the speed of his rage goes slower; and, as I say, retire with me
to my lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to hear my
lord speak. Pray ye, go! There's my key. If you do stir abroad,
go arm'd.

27
	

I,2,491
	

Brother, I advise you to the best. Go arm'd. I am no honest man
if there be any good meaning toward you. I have told you what I
have seen and heard; but faintly, nothing like the image and
horror of it. Pray you, away!

28
	

I,2,496
	

I do serve you in this business.
[Exit Edgar.]
A credulous father! and a brother noble,
Whose nature is so far from doing harms
That he suspects none; on whose foolish honesty
My practices ride easy! I see the business.
Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit;
All with me's meet that I can fashion fit. Exit.

29
	

II,1,927
	

Save thee, Curan.

30
	

II,1,931
	

How comes that?

31
	

II,1,934
	

Not I. Pray you, what are they?

32
	

II,1,937
	

Not a word.

33
	

II,1,939
	

The Duke be here to-night? The better! best!
This weaves itself perforce into my business.
My father hath set guard to take my brother;
And I have one thing, of a queasy question,
Which I must act. Briefness and fortune, work!
Brother, a word! Descend! Brother, I say!
[Enter Edgar.]
My father watches. O sir, fly this place!
Intelligence is given where you are hid.
You have now the good advantage of the night.
Have you not spoken 'gainst the Duke of Cornwall?
He's coming hither; now, i' th' night, i' th' haste,
And Regan with him. Have you nothing said
Upon his party 'gainst the Duke of Albany?
Advise yourself.

34
	

II,1,955
	

I hear my father coming. Pardon me!
In cunning I must draw my sword upon you.
Draw, seem to defend yourself; now quit you well.-
Yield! Come before my father. Light, ho, here!
Fly, brother.- Torches, torches!- So farewell.
[Exit Edgar.]
Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion
Of my more fierce endeavour. [Stabs his arm.] I have seen
drunkards
Do more than this in sport.- Father, father!-
Stop, stop! No help?

35
	

II,1,968
	

Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out,
Mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moon
To stand 's auspicious mistress.

36
	

II,1,972
	

Look, sir, I bleed.

37
	

II,1,974
	

Fled this way, sir. When by no means he could-

38
	

II,1,977
	

Persuade me to the murther of your lordship;
But that I told him the revenging gods
'Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend;
Spoke with how manifold and strong a bond
The child was bound to th' father- sir, in fine,
Seeing how loathly opposite I stood
To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion
With his prepared sword he charges home
My unprovided body, lanch'd mine arm;
But when he saw my best alarum'd spirits,
Bold in the quarrel's right, rous'd to th' encounter,
Or whether gasted by the noise I made,
Full suddenly he fled.

39
	

II,1,998
	

When I dissuaded him from his intent
And found him pight to do it, with curst speech
I threaten'd to discover him. He replied,
'Thou unpossessing bastard, dost thou think,
If I would stand against thee, would the reposal
Of any trust, virtue, or worth in thee
Make thy words faith'd? No. What I should deny
(As this I would; ay, though thou didst produce
My very character), I'ld turn it all
To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practice;
And thou must make a dullard of the world,
If they not thought the profits of my death
Were very pregnant and potential spurs
To make thee seek it.'

40
	

II,1,1034
	

Yes, madam, he was of that consort.

41
	

II,1,1045
	

'Twas my duty, sir.

42
	

II,1,1057
	

I shall serve you, sir,
Truly, however else.

43
	

II,2,1114
	

How now? What's the matter? Parts [them].

44
	

III,3,1783
	

Most savage and unnatural!

45
	

III,3,1795
	

This courtesy, forbid thee, shall the Duke
Instantly know, and of that letter too.
This seems a fair deserving, and must draw me
That which my father loses- no less than all.
The younger rises when the old doth fall. Exit.

46
	

III,5,1985
	

How, my lord, I may be censured, that nature thus gives way to
loyalty, something fears me to think of.

47
	

III,5,1990
	

How malicious is my fortune that I must repent to be just!
This is the letter he spoke of, which approves him an
intelligent party to the advantages of France. O heavens! that
this treason were not- or not I the detector!

48
	

III,5,1995
	

If the matter of this paper be certain, you have mighty
business in hand.

49
	

III,5,2000
	

[aside] If I find him comforting the King, it will stuff his
suspicion more fully.- I will persever in my course of loyalty,
though the conflict be sore between that and my blood.

50
	

IV,2,2365
	

Yours in the ranks of death! Exit.

51
	

V,1,3022
	

Know of the Duke if his last purpose hold,
Or whether since he is advis'd by aught
To change the course. He's full of alteration
And self-reproving. Bring his constant pleasure.

52
	

V,1,3028
	

Tis to be doubted, madam.

53
	

V,1,3033
	

In honour'd love.

54
	

V,1,3036
	

That thought abuses you.

55
	

V,1,3039
	

No, by mine honour, madam.

56
	

V,1,3042
	

Fear me not.
She and the Duke her husband!
Enter, with Drum and Colours, Albany, Goneril, Soldiers.

57
	

V,1,3055
	

Sir, you speak nobly.

58
	

V,1,3062
	

I shall attend you presently at your tent.

59
	

V,1,3086
	

The enemy 's in view; draw up your powers.
Here is the guess of their true strength and forces
By diligent discovery; but your haste
Is now urg'd on you.

60
	

V,1,3091
	

To both these sisters have I sworn my love;
Each jealous of the other, as the stung
Are of the adder. Which of them shall I take?
Both? one? or neither? Neither can be enjoy'd,
If both remain alive. To take the widow
Exasperates, makes mad her sister Goneril;
And hardly shall I carry out my side,
Her husband being alive. Now then, we'll use
His countenance for the battle, which being done,
Let her who would be rid of him devise
His speedy taking off. As for the mercy
Which he intends to Lear and to Cordelia-
The battle done, and they within our power,
Shall never see his pardon; for my state
Stands on me to defend, not to debate. Exit.

61
	

V,3,3123
	

Some officers take them away. Good guard
Until their greater pleasures first be known
That are to censure them.

62
	

V,3,3143
	

Take them away.

63
	

V,3,3151
	

Come hither, Captain; hark.
Take thou this note [gives a paper]. Go follow them to prison.
One step I have advanc'd thee. If thou dost
As this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way
To noble fortunes. Know thou this, that men
Are as the time is. To be tender-minded
Does not become a sword. Thy great employment
Will not bear question. Either say thou'lt do't,
Or thrive by other means.

64
	

V,3,3161
	

About it! and write happy when th' hast done.
Mark- I say, instantly; and carry it so
As I have set it down.

65
	

V,3,3173
	

Sir, I thought it fit
To send the old and miserable King
To some retention and appointed guard;
Whose age has charms in it, whose title more,
To pluck the common bosom on his side
And turn our impress'd lances in our eyes
Which do command them. With him I sent the Queen,
My reason all the same; and they are ready
To-morrow, or at further space, t' appear
Where you shall hold your session. At this time
We sweat and bleed: the friend hath lost his friend;
And the best quarrels, in the heat, are curs'd
By those that feel their sharpness.
The question of Cordelia and her father
Requires a fitter place.

66
	

V,3,3214
	

Nor in thine, lord.

67
	

V,3,3236
	

There's my exchange [throws down a glove]. What in the world
he is
That names me traitor, villain-like he lies.
Call by thy trumpet. He that dares approach,
On him, on you, who not? I will maintain
My truth and honour firmly.

68
	

V,3,3243
	

A herald, ho, a herald!

69
	

V,3,3257
	

Sound! First trumpet.

70
	

V,3,3273
	

Himself. What say'st thou to him?

71
	

V,3,3290
	

In wisdom I should ask thy name;
But since thy outside looks so fair and warlike,
And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes,
What safe and nicely I might well delay
By rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn.
Back do I toss those treasons to thy head;
With the hell-hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart;
Which- for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise-
This sword of mine shall give them instant way
Where they shall rest for ever. Trumpets, speak!

72
	

V,3,3318
	

What, you have charg'd me with, that have I done,
And more, much more. The time will bring it out.
'Tis past, and so am I.- But what art thou
That hast this fortune on me? If thou'rt noble,
I do forgive thee.

73
	

V,3,3331
	

Th' hast spoken right; 'tis true.
The wheel is come full circle; I am here.

74
	

V,3,3359
	

This speech of yours hath mov'd me,
And shall perchance do good; but speak you on;
You look as you had something more to say.

75
	

V,3,3394
	

I was contracted to them both. All three
Now marry in an instant.

76
	

V,3,3412
	

Yet Edmund was belov'd.
The one the other poisoned for my sake,
And after slew herself.

77
	

V,3,3416
	

I pant for life. Some good I mean to do,
Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send
(Be brief in't) to the castle; for my writ
Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia.
Nay, send in time.

78
	

V,3,3424
	

Well thought on. Take my sword;
Give it the Captain.

79
	

V,3,3427
	

He hath commission from thy wife and me
To hang Cordelia in the prison and
To lay the blame upon her own despair
That she fordid herself.

1
	

I,1,69
	

Sir, I am made
Of the selfsame metal that my sister is,
And prize me at her worth. In my true heart
I find she names my very deed of love;
Only she comes too short, that I profess
Myself an enemy to all other joys
Which the most precious square of sense possesses,
And find I am alone felicitate
In your dear Highness' love.

2
	

I,1,301
	

Let your study
Be to content your lord, who hath receiv'd you
At fortune's alms. You have obedience scanted,
And well are worth the want that you have wanted.

3
	

I,1,312
	

That's most certain, and with you; next month with us.

4
	

I,1,317
	

'Tis the infirmity of his age; yet he hath ever but slenderly
known himself.

5
	

I,1,324
	

Such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this
of Kent's banishment.

6
	

I,1,330
	

We shall further think on't.

7
	

II,1,1025
	

If it be true, all vengeance comes too short
Which can pursue th' offender. How dost, my lord?

8
	

II,1,1028
	

What, did my father's godson seek your life?
He whom my father nam'd? Your Edgar?

9
	

II,1,1031
	

Was he not companion with the riotous knights
That tend upon my father?

10
	

II,1,1035
	

No marvel then though he were ill affected.
'Tis they have put him on the old man's death,
To have th' expense and waste of his revenues.
I have this present evening from my sister
Been well inform'd of them, and with such cautions
That, if they come to sojourn at my house,
I'll not be there.

11
	

II,1,1061
	

Thus out of season, threading dark-ey'd night.
Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,
Wherein we must have use of your advice.
Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister,
Of differences, which I best thought it fit
To answer from our home. The several messengers
From hence attend dispatch. Our good old friend,
Lay comforts to your bosom, and bestow
Your needful counsel to our business,
Which craves the instant use.

12
	

II,2,1120
	

The messengers from our sister and the King

13
	

II,2,1206
	

Till noon? Till night, my lord, and all night too!

14
	

II,2,1209
	

Sir, being his knave, I will.

15
	

II,2,1222
	

My sister may receive it much more worse,
To have her gentleman abus'd, assaulted,
For following her affairs. Put in his legs.-
[Kent is put in the stocks.]
Come, my good lord, away.

16
	

II,4,1407
	

I am glad to see your Highness.

17
	

II,4,1418
	

I pray you, sir, take patience. I have hope
You less know how to value her desert
Than she to scant her duty.

18
	

II,4,1422
	

I cannot think my sister in the least
Would fail her obligation. If, sir, perchance
She have restrain'd the riots of your followers,
'Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end,
As clears her from all blame.

19
	

II,4,1428
	

O, sir, you are old!
Nature in you stands on the very verge
Of her confine. You should be rul'd, and led
By some discretion that discerns your state
Better than you yourself. Therefore I pray you
That to our sister you do make return;
Say you have wrong'd her, sir.

20
	

II,4,1440
	

Good sir, no more! These are unsightly tricks.
Return you to my sister.

21
	

II,4,1454
	

O the blest gods! so will you wish on me
When the rash mood is on.

22
	

II,4,1468
	

Good sir, to th' purpose.

23
	

II,4,1472
	

I know't- my sister's. This approves her letter,
That she would soon be here.
[Enter [Oswald the] Steward.]
Is your lady come?

24
	

II,4,1496
	

I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.
If, till the expiration of your month,
You will return and sojourn with my sister,
Dismissing half your train, come then to me.
I am now from home, and out of that provision
Which shall be needful for your entertainment.

25
	

II,4,1528
	

Not altogether so.
I look'd not for you yet, nor am provided
For your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister;
For those that mingle reason with your passion
Must be content to think you old, and so-
But she knows what she does.

26
	

II,4,1535
	

I dare avouch it, sir. What, fifty followers?
Is it not well? What should you need of more?
Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger
Speak 'gainst so great a number? How in one house
Should many people, under two commands,
Hold amity? 'Tis hard; almost impossible.

27
	

II,4,1543
	

Why not, my lord? If then they chanc'd to slack ye,
We could control them. If you will come to me
(For now I spy a danger), I entreat you
To bring but five-and-twenty. To no more
Will I give place or notice.

28
	

II,4,1549
	

And in good time you gave it!

29
	

II,4,1554
	

And speak't again my lord. No more with me.

30
	

II,4,1564
	

What need one?

31
	

II,4,1590
	

This house is little; the old man and 's people
Cannot be well bestow'd.

32
	

II,4,1594
	

For his particular, I'll receive him gladly,
But not one follower.

33
	

II,4,1609
	

O, sir, to wilful men
The injuries that they themselves procure
Must be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors.
He is attended with a desperate train,
And what they may incense him to, being apt
To have his ear abus'd, wisdom bids fear.

34
	

III,7,2125
	

Hang him instantly.

35
	

III,7,2150
	

Ingrateful fox! 'tis he.

36
	

III,7,2156
	

Hard, hard. O filthy traitor!

37
	

III,7,2162
	

So white, and such a traitor!

38
	

III,7,2169
	

Be simple-answer'd, for we know the truth.

39
	

III,7,2172
	

To whose hands have you sent the lunatic King?
Speak.

40
	

III,7,2178
	

And false.

41
	

III,7,2181
	

Wherefore to Dover? Wast thou not charg'd at peril-

42
	

III,7,2184
	

Wherefore to Dover, sir?

43
	

III,7,2200
	

One side will mock another. Th' other too!

44
	

III,7,2206
	

How now, you dog?

45
	

III,7,2209
	

What do you mean?

46
	

III,7,2212
	

Give me thy sword. A peasant stand up thus?
She takes a sword and runs at him behind.

47
	

III,7,2221
	

Out, treacherous villain!
Thou call'st on him that hates thee. It was he
That made the overture of thy treasons to us;
Who is too good to pity thee.

48
	

III,7,2227
	

Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smell
His way to Dover. [Exit one with Gloucester.]
How is't, my lord? How look you?

49
	

IV,5,2551
	

But are my brother's pow'rs set forth?

50
	

IV,5,2553
	

Himself in person there?

51
	

IV,5,2556
	

Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?

52
	

IV,5,2558
	

What might import my sister's letter to him?

53
	

IV,5,2560
	

Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.
It was great ignorance, Gloucester's eyes being out,
To let him live. Where he arrives he moves
All hearts against us. Edmund, I think, is gone,
In pity of his misery, to dispatch
His nighted life; moreover, to descry
The strength o' th' enemy.

54
	

IV,5,2568
	

Our troops set forth to-morrow. Stay with us.
The ways are dangerous.

55
	

IV,5,2572
	

Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you
Transport her purposes by word? Belike,
Something- I know not what- I'll love thee much-
Let me unseal the letter.

56
	

IV,5,2577
	

I know your lady does not love her husband;
I am sure of that; and at her late being here
She gave strange eyeliads and most speaking looks
To noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.

57
	

IV,5,2582
	

I speak in understanding. Y'are! I know't.
Therefore I do advise you take this note.
My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk'd,
And more convenient is he for my hand
Than for your lady's. You may gather more.
If you do find him, pray you give him this;
And when your mistress hears thus much from you,
I pray desire her call her wisdom to her.
So farewell.
If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,
Preferment falls on him that cuts him off.

58
	

IV,5,2595
	

Fare thee well. Exeunt.

59
	

V,1,3027
	

Our sister's man is certainly miscarried.

60
	

V,1,3029
	

Now, sweet lord,
You know the goodness I intend upon you.
Tell me- but truly- but then speak the truth-
Do you not love my sister?

61
	

V,1,3034
	

But have you never found my brother's way
To the forfended place?

62
	

V,1,3037
	

I am doubtful that you have been conjunct
And bosom'd with her, as far as we call hers.

63
	

V,1,3040
	

I never shall endure her. Dear my lord,
Be not familiar with her.

64
	

V,1,3056
	

Why is this reason'd?

65
	

V,1,3063
	

Sister, you'll go with us?

66
	

V,1,3065
	

'Tis most convenient. Pray you go with us.

67
	

V,3,3191
	

That's as we list to grace him.
Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded
Ere you had spoke so far. He led our powers,
Bore the commission of my place and person,
The which immediacy may well stand up
And call itself your brother.

68
	

V,3,3200
	

In my rights
By me invested, he compeers the best.

69
	

V,3,3203
	

Jesters do oft prove prophets.

70
	

V,3,3206
	

Lady, I am not well; else I should answer
From a full-flowing stomach. General,
Take thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony;
Dispose of them, of me; the walls are thine.
Witness the world that I create thee here
My lord and master.

71
	

V,3,3216
	

[to Edmund] Let the drum strike, and prove my title thine.

72
	

V,3,3234
	

Sick, O, sick!

73
	

V,3,3247
	

My sickness grows upon me.

1
	

I,1,33
	

Attend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.

2
	

I,1,36
	

Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.
Give me the map there. Know we have divided
In three our kingdom; and 'tis our fast intent
To shake all cares and business from our age,
Conferring them on younger strengths while we
Unburthen'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,
And you, our no less loving son of Albany,
We have this hour a constant will to publish
Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife
May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,
Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,
Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,
And here are to be answer'd. Tell me, my daughters
(Since now we will divest us both of rule,
Interest of territory, cares of state),
Which of you shall we say doth love us most?
That we our largest bounty may extend
Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,
Our eldest-born, speak first.

3
	

I,1,63
	

Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,
With shadowy forests and with champains rich'd,
With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,
We make thee lady. To thine and Albany's issue
Be this perpetual.- What says our second daughter,
Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak.

4
	

I,1,81
	

To thee and thine hereditary ever
Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom,
No less in space, validity, and pleasure
Than that conferr'd on Goneril.- Now, our joy,
Although the last, not least; to whose young love
The vines of France and milk of Burgundy
Strive to be interest; what can you say to draw
A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.

5
	

I,1,90
	

Nothing?

6
	

I,1,92
	

Nothing can come of nothing. Speak again.

7
	

I,1,96
	

How, how, Cordelia? Mend your speech a little,
Lest it may mar your fortunes.

8
	

I,1,108
	

But goes thy heart with this?

9
	

I,1,110
	

So young, and so untender?

10
	

I,1,112
	

Let it be so! thy truth then be thy dower!
For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,
The mysteries of Hecate and the night;
By all the operation of the orbs
From whom we do exist and cease to be;
Here I disclaim all my paternal care,
Propinquity and property of blood,
And as a stranger to my heart and me
Hold thee from this for ever. The barbarous Scythian,
Or he that makes his generation messes
To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom
Be as well neighbour'd, pitied, and reliev'd,
As thou my sometime daughter.

11
	

I,1,126
	

Peace, Kent!
Come not between the dragon and his wrath.
I lov'd her most, and thought to set my rest
On her kind nursery.- Hence and avoid my sight!-
So be my grave my peace as here I give
Her father's heart from her! Call France! Who stirs?
Call Burgundy! Cornwall and Albany,
With my two daughters' dowers digest this third;
Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.
I do invest you jointly in my power,
Preeminence, and all the large effects
That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,
With reservation of an hundred knights,
By you to be sustain'd, shall our abode
Make with you by due turns. Only we still retain
The name, and all th' additions to a king. The sway,
Revenue, execution of the rest,
Beloved sons, be yours; which to confirm,
This coronet part betwixt you.

12
	

I,1,149
	

The bow is bent and drawn; make from the shaft.

13
	

I,1,161
	

Kent, on thy life, no more!

14
	

I,1,165
	

Out of my sight!

15
	

I,1,168
	

Now by Apollo-

16
	

I,1,171
	

O vassal! miscreant! [Lays his hand on his sword.]

17
	

I,1,178
	

Hear me, recreant!
On thine allegiance, hear me!
Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow-
Which we durst never yet- and with strain'd pride
To come between our sentence and our power,-
Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,-
Our potency made good, take thy reward.
Five days we do allot thee for provision
To shield thee from diseases of the world,
And on the sixth to turn thy hated back
Upon our kingdom. If, on the tenth day following,
Thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions,
The moment is thy death. Away! By Jupiter,
This shall not be revok'd.

18
	

I,1,203
	

My Lord of Burgundy,
We first address toward you, who with this king
Hath rivall'd for our daughter. What in the least
Will you require in present dower with her,
Or cease your quest of love?

19
	

I,1,211
	

Right noble Burgundy,
When she was dear to us, we did hold her so;
But now her price is fall'n. Sir, there she stands.
If aught within that little seeming substance,
Or all of it, with our displeasure piec'd,
And nothing more, may fitly like your Grace,
She's there, and she is yours.

20
	

I,1,219
	

Will you, with those infirmities she owes,
Unfriended, new adopted to our hate,
Dow'r'd with our curse, and stranger'd with our oath,
Take her, or leave her?

21
	

I,1,225
	

Then leave her, sir; for, by the pow'r that made me,
I tell you all her wealth. [To France] For you, great King,
I would not from your love make such a stray
To match you where I hate; therefore beseech you
T' avert your liking a more worthier way
Than on a wretch whom nature is asham'd
Almost t' acknowledge hers.

22
	

I,1,254
	

Better thou
Hadst not been born than not t' have pleas'd me better.

23
	

I,1,267
	

Nothing! I have sworn; I am firm.

24
	

I,1,285
	

Thou hast her, France; let her be thine; for we
Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see
That face of hers again. Therefore be gone
Without our grace, our love, our benison.
Come, noble Burgundy.

25
	

I,4,543
	

Let me not stay a jot for dinner; go get it ready. [Exit
an Attendant.] How now? What art thou?

26
	

I,4,546
	

What dost thou profess? What wouldst thou with us?

27
	

I,4,551
	

What art thou?

28
	

I,4,553
	

If thou be'st as poor for a subject as he's for a king, thou
art poor enough. What wouldst thou?

29
	

I,4,556
	

Who wouldst thou serve?

30
	

I,4,558
	

Dost thou know me, fellow?

31
	

I,4,561
	

What's that?

32
	

I,4,563
	

What services canst thou do?

33
	

I,4,568
	

How old art thou?

34
	

I,4,571
	

Follow me; thou shalt serve me. If I like thee no worse after
dinner, I will not part from thee yet. Dinner, ho, dinner!
Where's my knave? my fool? Go you and call my fool hither.
[Exit an attendant.]
[Enter [Oswald the] Steward.]
You, you, sirrah, where's my daughter?

35
	

I,4,578
	

What says the fellow there? Call the clotpoll back.
[Exit a Knight.] Where's my fool, ho? I think the world's
asleep.
[Enter Knight]
How now? Where's that mongrel?

36
	

I,4,584
	

Why came not the slave back to me when I call'd him?

37
	

I,4,586
	

He would not?

38
	

I,4,592
	

Ha! say'st thou so?

39
	

I,4,595
	

Thou but rememb'rest me of mine own conception. I have
perceived a most faint neglect of late, which I have rather
blamed as mine own jealous curiosity than as a very pretence
and purpose of unkindness. I will look further into't. But
where's my fool? I have not seen him this two days.

40
	

I,4,602
	

No more of that; I have noted it well. Go you and tell my
daughter I would speak with her. [Exit Knight.] Go you, call
hither my fool.
[Exit an Attendant.]
[Enter [Oswald the] Steward.]
O, you, sir, you! Come you hither, sir. Who am I, sir?

41
	

I,4,609
	

'My lady's father'? My lord's knave! You whoreson dog! you
slave! you cur!

42
	

I,4,612
	

Do you bandy looks with me, you rascal?

43
	

I,4,617
	

I thank thee, fellow. Thou serv'st me, and I'll love thee.

44
	

I,4,622
	

Now, my friendly knave, I thank thee. There's earnest of thy
service. [Gives money.]

45
	

I,4,627
	

How now, my pretty knave? How dost thou?

46
	

I,4,636
	

Why, my boy?

47
	

I,4,639
	

Take heed, sirrah- the whip.

48
	

I,4,642
	

A pestilent gall to me!

49
	

I,4,644
	

Do.

50
	

I,4,659
	

Why, no, boy. Nothing can be made out of nothing.

51
	

I,4,662
	

A bitter fool!

52
	

I,4,665
	

No, lad; teach me.

53
	

I,4,674
	

Dost thou call me fool, boy?

54
	

I,4,683
	

What two crowns shall they be?

55
	

I,4,694
	

When were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah?

56
	

I,4,704
	

An you lie, sirrah, we'll have you whipp'd.

57
	

I,4,712
	

How now, daughter? What makes that frontlet on? Methinks you
are too much o' late i' th' frown.

58
	

I,4,740
	

Are you our daughter?

59
	

I,4,748
	

Doth any here know me? This is not Lear.
Doth Lear walk thus? speak thus? Where are his eyes?
Either his notion weakens, his discernings
Are lethargied- Ha! waking? 'Tis not so!
Who is it that can tell me who I am?

60
	

I,4,754
	

I would learn that; for, by the marks of sovereignty,
Knowledge, and reason, I should be false persuaded
I had daughters.

61
	

I,4,758
	

Your name, fair gentlewoman?

62
	

I,4,775
	

Darkness and devils!
Saddle my horses! Call my train together!
Degenerate bastard, I'll not trouble thee;
Yet have I left a daughter.

63
	

I,4,782
	

Woe that too late repents!- O, sir, are you come?
Is it your will? Speak, sir!- Prepare my horses.
Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend,
More hideous when thou show'st thee in a child
Than the sea-monster!

64
	

I,4,788
	

[to Goneril] Detested kite, thou liest!
My train are men of choice and rarest parts,
That all particulars of duty know
And in the most exact regard support
The worships of their name.- O most small fault,
How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show!
Which, like an engine, wrench'd my frame of nature
From the fix'd place; drew from my heart all love
And added to the gall. O Lear, Lear, Lear!
Beat at this gate that let thy folly in [Strikes his head.]
And thy dear judgment out! Go, go, my people.

65
	

I,4,801
	

It may be so, my lord.
Hear, Nature, hear! dear goddess, hear!
Suspend thy purpose, if thou didst intend
To make this creature fruitful.
Into her womb convey sterility;
Dry up in her the organs of increase;
And from her derogate body never spring
A babe to honour her! If she must teem,
Create her child of spleen, that it may live
And be a thwart disnatur'd torment to her.
Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth,
With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks,
Turn all her mother's pains and benefits
To laughter and contempt, that she may feel
How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is
To have a thankless child! Away, away! Exit.

66
	

I,4,822
	

What, fifty of my followers at a clap?
Within a fortnight?

67
	

I,4,825
	

I'll tell thee. [To Goneril] Life and death! I am asham'd
That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus;
That these hot tears, which break from me perforce,
Should make thee worth them. Blasts and fogs upon thee!
Th' untented woundings of a father's curse
Pierce every sense about thee!- Old fond eyes,
Beweep this cause again, I'll pluck ye out,
And cast you, with the waters that you lose,
To temper clay. Yea, is it come to this?
Let it be so. Yet have I left a daughter,
Who I am sure is kind and comfortable.
When she shall hear this of thee, with her nails
She'll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt find
That I'll resume the shape which thou dost think
I have cast off for ever; thou shalt, I warrant thee.

68
	

I,5,881
	

Go you before to Gloucester with these letters. Acquaint my
daughter no further with anything you know than comes from her
demand out of the letter. If your diligence be not speedy, I
shall be there afore you.

69
	

I,5,888
	

Ay, boy.

70
	

I,5,890
	

Ha, ha, ha!

71
	

I,5,894
	

What canst tell, boy?

72
	

I,5,897
	

No.

73
	

I,5,900
	

I did her wrong.

74
	

I,5,902
	

No.

75
	

I,5,904
	

Why?

76
	

I,5,907
	

I will forget my nature. So kind a father!- Be my horses
ready?

77
	

I,5,911
	

Because they are not eight?

78
	

I,5,913
	

To tak't again perforce! Monster ingratitude!

79
	

I,5,916
	

How's that?

80
	

I,5,918
	

O, let me not be mad, not mad, sweet heaven!
Keep me in temper; I would not be mad! [Enter a Gentleman.]
How now? Are the horses ready?

81
	

I,5,922
	

Come, boy.

82
	

II,4,1274
	

'Tis strange that they should so depart from home,
And not send back my messenger.

83
	

II,4,1280
	

Ha!
Mak'st thou this shame thy pastime?

84
	

II,4,1287
	

What's he that hath so much thy place mistook
To set thee here?

85
	

II,4,1291
	

No.

86
	

II,4,1293
	

No, I say.

87
	

II,4,1295
	

No, no, they would not!

88
	

II,4,1297
	

By Jupiter, I swear no!

89
	

II,4,1299
	

They durst not do't;
They would not, could not do't. 'Tis worse than murther
To do upon respect such violent outrage.
Resolve me with all modest haste which way
Thou mightst deserve or they impose this usage,
Coming from us.

90
	

II,4,1333
	

O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!
Hysterica passio! Down, thou climbing sorrow!
Thy element's below! Where is this daughter?

91
	

II,4,1337
	

Follow me not;
Stay here. Exit.

92
	

II,4,1364
	

Deny to speak with me? They are sick? they are weary?
They have travell'd all the night? Mere fetches-
The images of revolt and flying off!
Fetch me a better answer.

93
	

II,4,1372
	

Vengeance! plague! death! confusion!
Fiery? What quality? Why, Gloucester, Gloucester,
I'ld speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.

94
	

II,4,1376
	

Inform'd them? Dost thou understand me, man?

95
	

II,4,1378
	

The King would speak with Cornwall; the dear father
Would with his daughter speak, commands her service.
Are they inform'd of this? My breath and blood!
Fiery? the fiery Duke? Tell the hot Duke that-
No, but not yet! May be he is not well.
Infirmity doth still neglect all office
Whereto our health is bound. We are not ourselves
When nature, being oppress'd, commands the mind
To suffer with the body. I'll forbear;
And am fallen out with my more headier will,
To take the indispos'd and sickly fit
For the sound man.- Death on my state! Wherefore
Should he sit here? This act persuades me
That this remotion of the Duke and her
Is practice only. Give me my servant forth.
Go tell the Duke and 's wife I'ld speak with them-
Now, presently. Bid them come forth and hear me,
Or at their chamber door I'll beat the drum
Till it cry sleep to death.

96
	

II,4,1398
	

O me, my heart, my rising heart! But down!

97
	

II,4,1404
	

Good morrow to you both.

98
	

II,4,1408
	

Regan, I think you are; I know what reason
I have to think so. If thou shouldst not be glad,
I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb,
Sepulchring an adultress. [To Kent] O, are you free?
Some other time for that.- Beloved Regan,
Thy sister's naught. O Regan, she hath tied
Sharp-tooth'd unkindness, like a vulture, here!
[Lays his hand on his heart.]
I can scarce speak to thee. Thou'lt not believe
With how deprav'd a quality- O Regan!

99
	

II,4,1421
	

Say, how is that?

100
	

II,4,1427
	

My curses on her!

101
	

II,4,1435
	

Ask her forgiveness?
Do you but mark how this becomes the house:
'Dear daughter, I confess that I am old. [Kneels.]
Age is unnecessary. On my knees I beg
That you'll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.'

102
	

II,4,1442
	

[rises] Never, Regan!
She hath abated me of half my train;
Look'd black upon me; struck me with her tongue,
Most serpent-like, upon the very heart.
All the stor'd vengeances of heaven fall
On her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,
You taking airs, with lameness!

103
	

II,4,1450
	

You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames
Into her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty,
You fen-suck'd fogs, drawn by the pow'rful sun,
To fall and blast her pride!

104
	

II,4,1456
	

No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse.
Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give
Thee o'er to harshness. Her eyes are fierce; but thine
Do comfort, and not burn. 'Tis not in thee
To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,
To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,
And, in conclusion, to oppose the bolt
Against my coming in. Thou better know'st
The offices of nature, bond of childhood,
Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude.
Thy half o' th' kingdom hast thou not forgot,
Wherein I thee endow'd.

105
	

II,4,1470
	

Who put my man i' th' stocks?

106
	

II,4,1476
	

This is a slave, whose easy-borrowed pride
Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.
Out, varlet, from my sight!

107
	

II,4,1481
	

Who stock'd my servant? Regan, I have good hope
Thou didst not know on't.- Who comes here? O heavens!
If you do love old men, if your sweet sway
Allow obedience- if yourselves are old,
Make it your cause! Send down, and take my part!
[To Goneril] Art not asham'd to look upon this beard?-
O Regan, wilt thou take her by the hand?

108
	

II,4,1491
	

O sides, you are too tough!
Will you yet hold? How came my man i' th' stocks?

109
	

II,4,1495
	

You? Did you?

110
	

II,4,1502
	

Return to her, and fifty men dismiss'd?
No, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose
To wage against the enmity o' th' air,
To be a comrade with the wolf and owl-
Necessity's sharp pinch! Return with her?
Why, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took
Our youngest born, I could as well be brought
To knee his throne, and, squire-like, pension beg
To keep base life afoot. Return with her?
Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter
To this detested groom. [Points at Oswald.]

111
	

II,4,1514
	

I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad.
I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell.
We'll no more meet, no more see one another.
But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter;
Or rather a disease that's in my flesh,
Which I must needs call mine. Thou art a boil,
A plague sore, an embossed carbuncle
In my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee.
Let shame come when it will, I do not call it.
I do not bid the Thunder-bearer shoot
Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove.
Mend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure;
I can be patient, I can stay with Regan,
I and my hundred knights.

112
	

II,4,1534
	

Is this well spoken?

113
	

II,4,1548
	

I gave you all-

114
	

II,4,1550
	

Made you my guardians, my depositaries;
But kept a reservation to be followed
With such a number. What, must I come to you
With five-and-twenty, Regan? Said you so?

115
	

II,4,1555
	

Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour'd
When others are more wicked; not being the worst
Stands in some rank of praise. [To Goneril] I'll go with thee.
Thy fifty yet doth double five-and-twenty,
And thou art twice her love.

116
	

II,4,1565
	

O, reason not the need! Our basest beggars
Are in the poorest thing superfluous.
Allow not nature more than nature needs,
Man's life is cheap as beast's. Thou art a lady:
If only to go warm were gorgeous,
Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st
Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need-
You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!
You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,
As full of grief as age; wretched in both.
If it be you that stirs these daughters' hearts
Against their father, fool me not so much
To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,
And let not women's weapons, water drops,
Stain my man's cheeks! No, you unnatural hags!
I will have such revenges on you both
That all the world shall- I will do such things-
What they are yet, I know not; but they shall be
The terrors of the earth! You think I'll weep.
No, I'll not weep.
I have full cause of weeping, but this heart
Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws
Or ere I'll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!

117
	

III,2,1678
	

Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!
You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout
Till you have drench'd our steeples, drown'd the cocks!
You sulph'rous and thought-executing fires,
Vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts,
Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder,
Strike flat the thick rotundity o' th' world,
Crack Nature's moulds, all germains spill at once,
That makes ingrateful man!

118
	

III,2,1690
	

Rumble thy bellyful! Spit, fire! spout, rain!
Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire are my daughters.
I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness.
I never gave you kingdom, call'd you children,
You owe me no subscription. Then let fall
Your horrible pleasure. Here I stand your slave,
A poor, infirm, weak, and despis'd old man.
But yet I call you servile ministers,
That will with two pernicious daughters join
Your high-engender'd battles 'gainst a head
So old and white as this! O! O! 'tis foul!

119
	

III,2,1713
	

No, I will be the pattern of all patience;
I will say nothing.

120
	

III,2,1726
	

Let the great gods,
That keep this dreadful pudder o'er our heads,
Find out their enemies now. Tremble, thou wretch,
That hast within thee undivulged crimes
Unwhipp'd of justice. Hide thee, thou bloody hand;
Thou perjur'd, and thou simular man of virtue
That art incestuous. Caitiff, in pieces shake
That under covert and convenient seeming
Hast practis'd on man's life. Close pent-up guilts,
Rive your concealing continents, and cry
These dreadful summoners grace. I am a man
More sinn'd against than sinning.

121
	

III,2,1746
	

My wits begin to turn.
Come on, my boy. How dost, my boy? Art cold?
I am cold myself. Where is this straw, my fellow?
The art of our necessities is strange,
That can make vile things precious. Come, your hovel.
Poor fool and knave, I have one part in my heart
That's sorry yet for thee.

122
	

III,2,1758
	

True, my good boy. Come, bring us to this hovel.

123
	

III,4,1804
	

Let me alone.

124
	

III,4,1806
	

Wilt break my heart?

125
	

III,4,1808
	

Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious storm
Invades us to the skin. So 'tis to thee;
But where the greater malady is fix'd,
The lesser is scarce felt. Thou'dst shun a bear;
But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea,
Thou'dst meet the bear i' th' mouth. When the mind's free,
The body's delicate. The tempest in my mind
Doth from my senses take all feeling else
Save what beats there. Filial ingratitude!
Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand
For lifting food to't? But I will punish home!
No, I will weep no more. In such a night
To shut me out! Pour on; I will endure.
In such a night as this! O Regan, Goneril!
Your old kind father, whose frank heart gave all!
O, that way madness lies; let me shun that!
No more of that.

126
	

III,4,1826
	

Prithee go in thyself; seek thine own ease.
This tempest will not give me leave to ponder
On things would hurt me more. But I'll go in.
[To the Fool] In, boy; go first.- You houseless poverty-
Nay, get thee in. I'll pray, and then I'll sleep. [Exit Fool]
Poor naked wretches, wheresoe'er you are,
That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,
How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,
Your loop'd and window'd raggedness, defend you
From seasons such as these? O, I have ta'en
Too little care of this! Take physic, pomp;
Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
That thou mayst shake the superflux to them
And show the heavens more just.

127
	

III,4,1850
	

Hast thou given all to thy two daughters, and art thou come
to this?

128
	

III,4,1863
	

What, have his daughters brought him to this pass?
Couldst thou save nothing? Didst thou give 'em all?

129
	

III,4,1866
	

Now all the plagues that in the pendulous air
Hang fated o'er men's faults light on thy daughters!

130
	

III,4,1869
	

Death, traitor! nothing could have subdu'd nature
To such a lowness but his unkind daughters.
Is it the fashion that discarded fathers
Should have thus little mercy on their flesh?
Judicious punishment! 'Twas this flesh begot
Those pelican daughters.

131
	

III,4,1880
	

What hast thou been?

132
	

III,4,1896
	

Why, thou wert better in thy grave than to answer with thy
uncover'd body this extremity of the skies. Is man no more than
this? Consider him well. Thou ow'st the worm no silk, the beast
no hide, the sheep no wool, the cat no perfume. Ha! Here's three
on's are sophisticated! Thou art the thing itself;
unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor, bare, forked
animal as thou art. Off, off, you lendings! Come, unbutton
here.

133
	

III,4,1920
	

What's he?

134
	

III,4,1946
	

First let me talk with this philosopher.
What is the cause of thunder?

135
	

III,4,1949
	

I'll talk a word with this same learned Theban.
What is your study?

136
	

III,4,1952
	

Let me ask you one word in private.

137
	

III,4,1965
	

O, cry you mercy, sir.
Noble philosopher, your company.

138
	

III,4,1969
	

Come, let's in all.

139
	

III,4,1971
	

With him!
I will keep still with my philosopher.

140
	

III,4,1976
	

Come, good Athenian.

141
	

III,6,2017
	

A king, a king!

142
	

III,6,2020
	

To have a thousand with red burning spits
Come hizzing in upon 'em-

143
	

III,6,2025
	

It shall be done; I will arraign them straight.
[To Edgar] Come, sit thou here, most learned justicer.
[To the Fool] Thou, sapient sir, sit here. Now, you she-foxes!

144
	

III,6,2039
	

I'll see their trial first. Bring in their evidence.
[To Edgar] Thou, robed man of justice, take thy place.
[To the Fool] And thou, his yokefellow of equity,
Bench by his side. [To Kent] You are o' th' commission,
Sit you too.

145
	

III,6,2050
	

Arraign her first. 'Tis Goneril. I here take my oath before
this honourable assembly, she kicked the poor King her father.

146
	

III,6,2053
	

She cannot deny it.

147
	

III,6,2055
	

And here's another, whose warp'd looks proclaim
What store her heart is made on. Stop her there!
Arms, arms! sword! fire! Corruption in the place!
False justicer, why hast thou let her scape?

148
	

III,6,2064
	

The little dogs and all,
Tray, Blanch, and Sweetheart, see, they bark at me.

149
	

III,6,2077
	

Then let them anatomize Regan. See what breeds about her
heart. Is there any cause in nature that makes these hard
hearts? [To Edgar] You, sir- I entertain you for one of my
hundred; only I do not like the fashion of your garments. You'll
say they are Persian attire; but let them be chang'd.

150
	

III,6,2083
	

Make no noise, make no noise; draw the curtains.
So, so, so. We'll go to supper i' th' morning. So, so, so.

151
	

IV,6,2694
	

No, they cannot touch me for coming;
I am the King himself.

152
	

IV,6,2697
	

Nature 's above art in that respect. There's your press
money. That fellow handles his bow like a crow-keeper. Draw me
a clothier's yard. Look, look, a mouse! Peace, peace; this piece
of toasted cheese will do't. There's my gauntlet; I'll prove it
on a giant. Bring up the brown bills. O, well flown, bird! i'
th' clout, i' th' clout! Hewgh! Give the word.

153
	

IV,6,2704
	

Pass.

154
	

IV,6,2706
	

Ha! Goneril with a white beard? They flatter'd me like a dog,
and told me I had white hairs in my beard ere the black ones
were there. To say 'ay' and 'no' to everything I said! 'Ay' and
'no' too was no good divinity. When the rain came to wet me
once, and the wind to make me chatter; when the thunder would
not peace at my bidding; there I found 'em, there I smelt 'em
out. Go to, they are not men o' their words! They told me I was
everything. 'Tis a lie- I am not ague-proof.

155
	

IV,6,2716
	

Ay, every inch a king!
When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.
I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause?
Adultery?
Thou shalt not die. Die for adultery? No.
The wren goes to't, and the small gilded fly
Does lecher in my sight.
Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester's bastard son
Was kinder to his father than my daughters
Got 'tween the lawful sheets.
To't, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.
Behold yond simp'ring dame,
Whose face between her forks presageth snow,
That minces virtue, and does shake the head
To hear of pleasure's name.
The fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to't
With a more riotous appetite.
Down from the waist they are Centaurs,
Though women all above.
But to the girdle do the gods inherit,
Beneath is all the fiend's.
There's hell, there's darkness, there's the sulphurous pit;
burning, scalding, stench, consumption. Fie, fie, fie! pah, pah!
Give me an ounce of civet, good apothecary, to sweeten my
imagination. There's money for thee.

156
	

IV,6,2742
	

Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.

157
	

IV,6,2745
	

I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny at me?
No, do thy worst, blind Cupid! I'll not love. Read thou this
challenge; mark but the penning of it.

158
	

IV,6,2751
	

Read.

159
	

IV,6,2753
	

O, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your head, nor no
money in your purse? Your eyes are in a heavy case, your purse
in a light. Yet you see how this world goes.

160
	

IV,6,2757
	

What, art mad? A man may see how the world goes with no eyes.
Look with thine ears. See how yond justice rails upon yond
simple thief. Hark in thine ear. Change places and, handy-dandy,
which is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen a
farmer's dog bark at a beggar?

161
	

IV,6,2763
	

And the creature run from the cur? There thou mightst behold
the great image of authority: a dog's obeyed in office.
Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!
Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back.
Thou hotly lusts to use her in that kind
For which thou whip'st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.
Through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear;
Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks;
Arm it in rags, a pygmy's straw does pierce it.
None does offend, none- I say none! I'll able 'em.
Take that of me, my friend, who have the power
To seal th' accuser's lips. Get thee glass eyes
And, like a scurvy politician, seem
To see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now!
Pull off my boots. Harder, harder! So.

162
	

IV,6,2781
	

If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.
I know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester.
Thou must be patient. We came crying hither;
Thou know'st, the first time that we smell the air
We wawl and cry. I will preach to thee. Mark.

163
	

IV,6,2787
	

When we are born, we cry that we are come
To this great stage of fools. This' a good block.
It were a delicate stratagem to shoe
A troop of horse with felt. I'll put't in proof,
And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law,
Then kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!

164
	

IV,6,2796
	

No rescue? What, a prisoner? I am even
The natural fool of fortune. Use me well;
You shall have ransom. Let me have a surgeon;
I am cut to th' brains.

165
	

IV,6,2801
	

No seconds? All myself?
Why, this would make a man a man of salt,
To use his eyes for garden waterpots,
Ay, and laying autumn's dust.

166
	

IV,6,2806
	

I will die bravely, like a smug bridegroom. What!
I will be jovial. Come, come, I am a king;
My masters, know you that?

IV,6,2810
	

Then there's life in't. Nay, an you get it, you shall get it
by running. Sa, sa, sa, sa!

168
	

IV,7,2961
	

You do me wrong to take me out o' th' grave.
Thou art a soul in bliss; but I am bound
Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears
Do scald like molten lead.

169
	

IV,7,2966
	

You are a spirit, I know. When did you die?

170
	

IV,7,2969
	

Where have I been? Where am I? Fair daylight,
I am mightily abus'd. I should e'en die with pity,
To see another thus. I know not what to say.
I will not swear these are my hands. Let's see.
I feel this pin prick. Would I were assur'd
Of my condition!

171
	

IV,7,2978
	

Pray, do not mock me.
I am a very foolish fond old man,
Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less;
And, to deal plainly,
I fear I am not in my perfect mind.
Methinks I should know you, and know this man;
Yet I am doubtful; for I am mainly ignorant
What place this is; and all the skill I have
Remembers not these garments; nor I know not
Where I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me;
For (as I am a man) I think this lady
To be my child Cordelia.

172
	

IV,7,2991
	

Be your tears wet? Yes, faith. I pray weep not.
If you have poison for me, I will drink it.
I know you do not love me; for your sisters
Have, as I do remember, done me wrong.
You have some cause, they have not.

173
	

IV,7,2997
	

Am I in France?

174
	

IV,7,2999
	

Do not abuse me.

175
	

IV,7,3006
	

You must bear with me.
Pray you now, forget and forgive. I am old and foolish.

176
	

V,3,3131
	

No, no, no, no! Come, let's away to prison.
We two alone will sing like birds i' th' cage.
When thou dost ask me blessing, I'll kneel down
And ask of thee forgiveness. So we'll live,
And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh
At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues
Talk of court news; and we'll talk with them too-
Who loses and who wins; who's in, who's out-
And take upon 's the mystery of things,
As if we were God's spies; and we'll wear out,
In a wall'd prison, packs and sects of great ones
That ebb and flow by th' moon.

177
	

V,3,3144
	

Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,
The gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught thee?
He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven
And fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes.
The goodyears shall devour 'em, flesh and fell,
Ere they shall make us weep! We'll see 'em starv'd first.
Come. Exeunt [Lear and Cordelia, guarded].

178
	

V,3,3434
	

Howl, howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stone.
Had I your tongues and eyes, I'ld use them so
That heaven's vault should crack. She's gone for ever!
I know when one is dead, and when one lives.
She's dead as earth. Lend me a looking glass.
If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,
Why, then she lives.

179
	

V,3,3444
	

This feather stirs; she lives! If it be so,
It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows
That ever I have felt.

180
	

V,3,3448
	

Prithee away!

181
	

V,3,3450
	

A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!
I might have sav'd her; now she's gone for ever!
Cordelia, Cordelia! stay a little. Ha!
What is't thou say'st, Her voice was ever soft,
Gentle, and low- an excellent thing in woman.
I kill'd the slave that was a-hanging thee.

182
	

V,3,3457
	

Did I not, fellow?
I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion
I would have made them skip. I am old now,
And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?
Mine eyes are not o' th' best. I'll tell you straight.

183
	

V,3,3464
	

This' a dull sight. Are you not Kent?

184
	

V,3,3467
	

He's a good fellow, I can tell you that.
He'll strike, and quickly too. He's dead and rotten.

185
	

V,3,3470
	

I'll see that straight.

186
	

V,3,3473
	

You're welcome hither.

187
	

V,3,3477
	

Ay, so I think.

188
	

V,3,3494
	

And my poor fool is hang'd! No, no, no life!
Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,
And thou no breath at all? Thou'lt come no more,
Never, never, never, never, never!
Pray you undo this button. Thank you, sir.
Do you see this? Look on her! look! her lips!
Look there, look there! He dies.

I,4,625
	

Let me hire him too. Here's my coxcomb.

2
	

I,4,628
	

Sirrah, you were best take my coxcomb.

3
	

I,4,630
	

Why? For taking one's part that's out of favour. Nay, an thou
canst not smile as the wind sits, thou'lt catch cold shortly.
There, take my coxcomb! Why, this fellow hath banish'd two on's
daughters, and did the third a blessing against his will. If
thou follow him, thou must needs wear my coxcomb.- How now,
nuncle? Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters!

4
	

I,4,637
	

If I gave them all my living, I'ld keep my coxcombs myself.
There's mine! beg another of thy daughters.

5
	

I,4,640
	

Truth's a dog must to kennel; he must be whipp'd out, when
Lady the brach may stand by th' fire and stink.

6
	

I,4,643
	

Sirrah, I'll teach thee a speech.

7
	

I,4,645
	

Mark it, nuncle.
Have more than thou showest,
Speak less than thou knowest,
Lend less than thou owest,
Ride more than thou goest,
Learn more than thou trowest,
Set less than thou throwest;
Leave thy drink and thy whore,
And keep in-a-door,
And thou shalt have more
Than two tens to a score.

8
	

I,4,657
	

Then 'tis like the breath of an unfeed lawyer- you gave me
nothing for't. Can you make no use of nothing, nuncle?

9
	

I,4,660
	

[to Kent] Prithee tell him, so much the rent of his land
comes to. He will not believe a fool.

10
	

I,4,663
	

Dost thou know the difference, my boy, between a bitter
fool and a sweet fool?

11
	

I,4,666
	

That lord that counsell'd thee
To give away thy land,
Come place him here by me-
Do thou for him stand.
The sweet and bitter fool
Will presently appear;
The one in motley here,
The other found out there.

12
	

I,4,675
	

All thy other titles thou hast given away; that thou wast
born with.

13
	

I,4,678
	

No, faith; lords and great men will not let me. If I had a
monopoly out, they would have part on't. And ladies too, they
will not let me have all the fool to myself; they'll be
snatching. Give me an egg, nuncle, and I'll give thee two
crowns.

14
	

I,4,684
	

Why, after I have cut the egg i' th' middle and eat up the
meat, the two crowns of the egg. When thou clovest thy crown i'
th' middle and gav'st away both parts, thou bor'st thine ass on
thy back o'er the dirt. Thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown
when thou gav'st thy golden one away. If I speak like myself in
this, let him be whipp'd that first finds it so.
[Sings] Fools had ne'er less grace in a year,
For wise men are grown foppish;
They know not how their wits to wear,
Their manners are so apish.

15
	

I,4,695
	

I have us'd it, nuncle, ever since thou mad'st thy daughters
thy mother; for when thou gav'st them the rod, and put'st down
thine own breeches,
[Sings] Then they for sudden joy did weep,
And I for sorrow sung,
That such a king should play bo-peep
And go the fools among.
Prithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool to
lie. I would fain learn to lie.

16
	

I,4,705
	

I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are. They'll have me
whipp'd for speaking true; thou'lt have me whipp'd for lying;
and sometimes I am whipp'd for holding my peace. I had rather be
any kind o' thing than a fool! And yet I would not be thee,
nuncle. Thou hast pared thy wit o' both sides and left nothing
i' th' middle. Here comes one o' the parings.

17
	

I,4,714
	

Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to care for
her frowning. Now thou art an O without a figure. I am better
than thou art now: I am a fool, thou art nothing.
[To Goneril] Yes, forsooth, I will hold my tongue. So your face
bids me, though you say nothing. Mum, mum!
He that keeps nor crust nor crum,
Weary of all, shall want some.-
[Points at Lear] That's a sheal'd peascod.

18
	

I,4,736
	

For you know, nuncle,
The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long
That it had it head bit off by it young.
So out went the candle, and we were left darkling.

19
	

I,4,746
	

May not an ass know when the cart draws the horse?
Whoop, Jug, I love thee!

20
	

I,4,753
	

Lear's shadow.

21
	

I,4,757
	

Which they will make an obedient father.

22
	

I,4,846
	

Nuncle Lear, nuncle Lear, tarry! Take the fool with thee.
A fox when one has caught her,
And such a daughter,
Should sure to the slaughter,
If my cap would buy a halter.
So the fool follows after. Exit.

23
	

I,5,886
	

If a man's brains were in's heels, were't not in danger of
kibes?

24
	

I,5,889
	

Then I prithee be merry. Thy wit shall ne'er go slip-shod.

25
	

I,5,891
	

Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly; for though
she's as like this as a crab's like an apple, yet I can tell
what I can tell.

26
	

I,5,895
	

She'll taste as like this as a crab does to a crab. Thou
canst tell why one's nose stands i' th' middle on's face?

27
	

I,5,898
	

Why, to keep one's eyes of either side's nose, that what a
man cannot smell out, 'a may spy into.

28
	

I,5,901
	

Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell?

29
	

I,5,903
	

Nor I neither; but I can tell why a snail has a house.

30
	

I,5,905
	

Why, to put's head in; not to give it away to his daughters,
and leave his horns without a case.

31
	

I,5,909
	

Thy asses are gone about 'em. The reason why the seven stars
are no moe than seven is a pretty reason.

32
	

I,5,912
	

Yes indeed. Thou wouldst make a good fool.

33
	

I,5,914
	

If thou wert my fool, nuncle, I'ld have thee beaten for being
old before thy time.

34
	

I,5,917
	

Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst been wise.

35
	

I,5,923
	

She that's a maid now, and laughs at my departure,
Shall not be a maid long, unless things be cut shorter

36
	

II,4,1283
	

Ha, ha! look! he wears cruel garters. Horses are tied by the
head, dogs and bears by th' neck, monkeys by th' loins, and men
by th' legs. When a man's over-lusty at legs, then he wears
wooden nether-stocks.

37
	

II,4,1324
	

Winter's not gone yet, if the wild geese fly that way.
Fathers that wear rags
Do make their children blind;
But fathers that bear bags
Shall see their children kind.
Fortune, that arrant whore,
Ne'er turns the key to th' poor.
But for all this, thou shalt have as many dolours for thy
daughters as thou canst tell in a year.

38
	

II,4,1342
	

An thou hadst been set i' th' stocks for that question,
thou'dst well deserv'd it.

39
	

II,4,1345
	

We'll set thee to school to an ant, to teach thee there's no
labouring i' th' winter. All that follow their noses are led by
their eyes but blind men, and there's not a nose among twenty
but can smell him that's stinking. Let go thy hold when a great
wheel runs down a hill, lest it break thy neck with following
it; but the great one that goes upward, let him draw thee after.
When a wise man gives thee better counsel, give me mine again. I
would have none but knaves follow it, since a fool gives it.
That sir which serves and seeks for gain,
And follows but for form,
Will pack when it begins to rain
And leave thee in the storm.
But I will tarry; the fool will stay,
And let the wise man fly.
The knave turns fool that runs away;
The fool no knave, perdy.

40
	

II,4,1362
	

Not i' th' stocks, fool.
Enter Lear and Gloucester

41
	

II,4,1399
	

Cry to it, nuncle, as the cockney did to the eels when she
put 'em i' th' paste alive. She knapp'd 'em o' th' coxcombs with
a stick and cried 'Down, wantons, down!' 'Twas her brother that,
in pure kindness to his horse, buttered his hay.

42
	

III,2,1687
	

O nuncle, court holy water in a dry house is better than this
rain water out o' door. Good nuncle, in, and ask thy daughters
blessing! Here's a night pities nether wise men nor fools.

43
	

III,2,1701
	

He that has a house to put 's head in has a good head-piece.
The codpiece that will house
Before the head has any,
The head and he shall louse:
So beggars marry many.
The man that makes his toe
What he his heart should make
Shall of a corn cry woe,
And turn his sleep to wake.
For there was never yet fair woman but she made mouths in a
glass.

44
	

III,2,1716
	

Marry, here's grace and a codpiece; that's a wise man and a
fool.

45
	

III,2,1753
	

[sings]
He that has and a little tiny wit-
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain-
Must make content with his fortunes fit,
For the rain it raineth every day.

46
	

III,2,1760
	

This is a brave night to cool a courtesan. I'll speak a
prophecy ere I go:
When priests are more in word than matter;
When brewers mar their malt with water;
When nobles are their tailors' tutors,
No heretics burn'd, but wenches' suitors;
When every case in law is right,
No squire in debt nor no poor knight;
When slanders do not live in tongues,
Nor cutpurses come not to throngs;
When usurers tell their gold i' th' field,
And bawds and whores do churches build:
Then shall the realm of Albion
Come to great confusion.
Then comes the time, who lives to see't,
That going shall be us'd with feet.
This prophecy Merlin shall make, for I live before his time. Exit.

47
	

III,4,1842
	

Come not in here, nuncle, here's a spirit. Help me, help me!

48
	

III,4,1844
	

A spirit, a spirit! He says his name's poor Tom.

49
	

III,4,1865
	

Nay, he reserv'd a blanket, else we had been all sham'd.

50
	

III,4,1876
	

This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen.

51
	

III,4,1905
	

Prithee, nuncle, be contented! 'Tis a naughty night to swim
in. Now a little fire in a wild field were like an old lecher's
heart- a small spark, all the rest on's body cold. Look, here
comes a walking fire.

52
	

III,6,2015
	

Prithee, nuncle, tell me whether a madman be a gentleman or a
yeoman.

53
	

III,6,2018
	

No, he's a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son; for he's a
mad yeoman that sees his son a gentleman before him.

54
	

III,6,2023
	

He's mad that trusts in the tameness of a wolf, a horse's
health, a boy's love, or a whore's oath.

55
	

III,6,2031
	

Her boat hath a leak,
And she must not speak
Why she dares not come over to thee.

56
	

III,6,2052
	

Come hither, mistress. Is your name Goneril?

57
	

III,6,2054
	

Cry you mercy, I took you for a joint-stool.

58
	

III,6,2085
	

And I'll go to bed at noon.

Good my liege-

I,1,145
	

Royal Lear,
Whom I have ever honour'd as my king,
Lov'd as my father, as my master follow'd,
As my great patron thought on in my prayers-

8
	

I,1,150
	

Let it fall rather, though the fork invade
The region of my heart! Be Kent unmannerly
When Lear is mad. What wouldst thou do, old man?
Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak
When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour's bound
When majesty falls to folly. Reverse thy doom;
And in thy best consideration check
This hideous rashness. Answer my life my judgment,
Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least,
Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound
Reverbs no hollowness.

9
	

I,1,162
	

My life I never held but as a pawn
To wage against thine enemies; nor fear to lose it,
Thy safety being the motive.

10
	

I,1,166
	

See better, Lear, and let me still remain
The true blank of thine eye.

11
	

I,1,169
	

Now by Apollo, King,
Thou swear'st thy gods in vain.

12
	

I,1,173
	

Do!
Kill thy physician, and the fee bestow
Upon the foul disease. Revoke thy gift,
Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat,
I'll tell thee thou dost evil.

13
	

I,1,192
	

Fare thee well, King. Since thus thou wilt appear,
Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here.
[To Cordelia] The gods to their dear shelter take thee, maid,
That justly think'st and hast most rightly said!
[To Regan and Goneril] And your large speeches may your deeds
approve,
That good effects may spring from words of love.
Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu;
He'll shape his old course in a country new. Exit.

14
	

I,4,535
	

If but as well I other accents borrow,
That can my speech defuse, my good intent
May carry through itself to that full issue
For which I raz'd my likeness. Now, banish'd Kent,
If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemn'd,
So may it come, thy master, whom thou lov'st,
Shall find thee full of labours.
Horns within. Enter Lear, [Knights,] and Attendants.

15
	

I,4,545
	

A man, sir.

16
	

I,4,547
	

I do profess to be no less than I seem, to serve him truly
that will put me in trust, to love him that is honest, to
converse with him that is wise and says little, to fear
judgment, to fight when I cannot choose, and to eat no fish.

17
	

I,4,552
	

A very honest-hearted fellow, and as poor as the King.

18
	

I,4,555
	

Service.

19
	

I,4,557
	

You.

20
	

I,4,559
	

No, sir; but you have that in your countenance which I would
fain call master.

21
	

I,4,562
	

Authority.

22
	

I,4,564
	

I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a curious tale in
telling it and deliver a plain message bluntly. That which
ordinary men are fit for, I am qualified in, and the best of me
is diligence.

23
	

I,4,569
	

Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing, nor so old to
dote on her for anything. I have years on my back forty-eight.

24
	

I,4,615
	

Nor tripp'd neither, you base football player?

25

Come, sir, arise, away! I'll teach you differences. Away,
away! If you will measure your lubber's length again, tarry; but
away! Go to! Have you wisdom? So.

This is nothing, fool.

28

If I had thee in Lipsbury Pinfold, I would make thee care for
me.

34
	

II,2,1085
	

Fellow, I know thee.

35
	

II,2,1087
	

A knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats; a base, proud,
shallow, beggarly, three-suited, hundred-pound, filthy,
worsted-stocking knave; a lily-liver'd, action-taking, whoreson,
glass-gazing, superserviceable, finical rogue;
one-trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a bawd in way of
good service, and art nothing but the composition of a knave,
beggar, coward, pander, and the son and heir of a mongrel bitch;
one whom I will beat into clamorous whining, if thou deny the
least syllable of thy addition.

36
	

II,2,1098
	

What a brazen-fac'd varlet art thou, to deny thou knowest me!
Is it two days ago since I beat thee and tripp'd up thy heels
before the King? [Draws his sword.] Draw, you rogue! for, though
it be night, yet the moon shines. I'll make a sop o' th'
moonshine o' you. Draw, you whoreson cullionly barbermonger!
draw!

37
	

II,2,1105
	

Draw, you rascal! You come with letters against the King, and
take Vanity the puppet's part against the royalty of her father.
Draw, you rogue, or I'll so carbonado your shanks! Draw, you
rascal! Come your ways!

Strike! [Beats him.]

Come on, young master!

40
	

II,2,1123
	

No marvel, you have so bestirr'd your valour. You cowardly
rascal, nature disclaims in thee; a tailor made thee.

41
	

II,2,1126
	

Ay, a tailor, sir. A stonecutter or a painter could not have
made him so ill, though he had been but two hours at the trade.

42
	

II,2,1131
	

Thou whoreson zed! thou unnecessary letter! My lord, if
you'll give me leave, I will tread this unbolted villain into
mortar and daub the walls of a jakes with him. 'Spare my grey
beard,' you wagtail?

43
	

II,2,1137
	

Yes, sir, but anger hath a privilege.

44
	

II,2,1139
	

That such a slave as this should wear a sword,
Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these,
Like rats, oft bite the holy cords atwain
Which are too intrinse t' unloose; smooth every passion
That in the natures of their lords rebel,
Bring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods;
Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks
With every gale and vary of their masters,
Knowing naught (like dogs) but following.
A plague upon your epileptic visage!
Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool?
Goose, an I had you upon Sarum Plain,
I'ld drive ye cackling home to Camelot.

45
	

II,2,1154
	

No contraries hold more antipathy
Than I and such a knave.

46
	

II,2,1157
	

His countenance likes me not.

47
	

II,2,1159
	

Sir, 'tis my occupation to be plain.
I have seen better faces in my time
Than stands on any shoulder that I see
Before me at this instant.

48
	

II,2,1173
	

Sir, in good faith, in sincere verity,
Under th' allowance of your great aspect,
Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire
On flickering Phoebus' front-

49
	

II,2,1178
	

To go out of my dialect, which you discommend so much. I
know, sir, I am no flatterer. He that beguil'd you in a plain
accent was a plain knave, which, for my part, I will not be,
though I should win your displeasure to entreat me to't.

50
	

II,2,1193
	

None of these rogues and cowards
But Ajax is their fool.

51
	

II,2,1198
	

Sir, I am too old to learn.
Call not your stocks for me. I serve the King;
On whose employment I was sent to you.
You shall do small respect, show too bold malice
Against the grace and person of my master,
Stocking his messenger.

52
	

II,2,1207
	

Why, madam, if I were your father's dog,
You should not use me so.

53
	

II,2,1231
	

Pray do not, sir. I have watch'd and travell'd hard.
Some time I shall sleep out, the rest I'll whistle.
A good man's fortune may grow out at heels.
Give you good morrow!

54
	

II,2,1236
	

Good King, that must approve the common saw,
Thou out of heaven's benediction com'st
To the warm sun!
Approach, thou beacon to this under globe,
That by thy comfortable beams I may
Peruse this letter. Nothing almost sees miracles
But misery. I know 'tis from Cordelia,
Who hath most fortunately been inform'd
Of my obscured course- and [reads] 'shall find time
From this enormous state, seeking to give
Losses their remedies'- All weary and o'erwatch'd,
Take vantage, heavy eyes, not to behold
This shameful lodging.
Fortune, good night; smile once more, turn thy wheel.

55
	

II,4,1279
	

Hail to thee, noble master!

56
	

II,4,1282
	

No, my lord.

57
	

II,4,1289
	

It is both he and she-
Your son and daughter.

58
	

II,4,1292
	

Yes.

59
	

II,4,1294
	

I say yea.

60
	

II,4,1296
	

Yes, they have.

61
	

II,4,1298
	

By Juno, I swear ay!

62
	

II,4,1305
	

My lord, when at their home
I did commend your Highness' letters to them,
Ere I was risen from the place that show'd
My duty kneeling, came there a reeking post,
Stew'd in his haste, half breathless, panting forth
From Goneril his mistress salutations;
Deliver'd letters, spite of intermission,
Which presently they read; on whose contents,
They summon'd up their meiny, straight took horse,
Commanded me to follow and attend
The leisure of their answer, gave me cold looks,
And meeting here the other messenger,
Whose welcome I perceiv'd had poison'd mine-
Being the very fellow which of late
Display'd so saucily against your Highness-
Having more man than wit about me, drew.
He rais'd the house with loud and coward cries.
Your son and daughter found this trespass worth
The shame which here it suffers.

63
	

II,4,1336
	

With the Earl, sir, here within.

64
	

II,4,1340
	

None.
How chance the King comes with so small a number?

65
	

II,4,1344
	

Why, fool?

66
	

II,4,1361
	

Where learn'd you this, fool?

67
	

III,1,1618
	

Who's there, besides foul weather?

68
	

III,1,1620
	

I know you. Where's the King?

69
	

III,1,1633
	

But who is with him?

70
	

III,1,1636
	

Sir, I do know you,
And dare upon the warrant of my note
Commend a dear thing to you. There is division
(Although as yet the face of it be cover'd
With mutual cunning) 'twixt Albany and Cornwall;
Who have (as who have not, that their great stars
Thron'd and set high?) servants, who seem no less,
Which are to France the spies and speculations
Intelligent of our state. What hath been seen,
Either in snuffs and packings of the Dukes,
Or the hard rein which both of them have borne
Against the old kind King, or something deeper,
Whereof, perchance, these are but furnishings-
But, true it is, from France there comes a power
Into this scattered kingdom, who already,
Wise in our negligence, have secret feet
In some of our best ports and are at point
To show their open banner. Now to you:
If on my credit you dare build so far
To make your speed to Dover, you shall find
Some that will thank you, making just report
Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow
The King hath cause to plain.
I am a gentleman of blood and breeding,
And from some knowledge and assurance offer
This office to you.

71
	

III,1,1663
	

No, do not.
For confirmation that I am much more
Than my out-wall, open this purse and take
What it contains. If you shall see Cordelia
(As fear not but you shall), show her this ring,
And she will tell you who your fellow is
That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!
I will go seek the King.

72
	

III,1,1672
	

Few words, but, to effect, more than all yet:
That, when we have found the King (in which your pain
That way, I'll this), he that first lights on him
Holla the other.

73
	

III,2,1715
	

Who's there?

74
	

III,2,1718
	

Alas, sir, are you here? Things that love night
Love not such nights as these. The wrathful skies
Gallow the very wanderers of the dark
And make them keep their caves. Since I was man,
Such sheets of fire, such bursts of horrid thunder,
Such groans of roaring wind and rain, I never
Remember to have heard. Man's nature cannot carry
Th' affliction nor the fear.

75
	

III,2,1738
	

Alack, bareheaded?
Gracious my lord, hard by here is a hovel;
Some friendship will it lend you 'gainst the tempest.
Repose you there, whilst I to this hard house
(More harder than the stones whereof 'tis rais'd,
Which even but now, demanding after you,
Denied me to come in) return, and force
Their scanted courtesy.

76
	

III,4,1801
	

Here is the place, my lord. Good my lord, enter.
The tyranny of the open night 's too rough
For nature to endure.

77
	

III,4,1805
	

Good my lord, enter here.

78
	

III,4,1807
	

I had rather break mine own. Good my lord, enter.

79
	

III,4,1825
	

Good my lord, enter here.

80
	

III,4,1843
	

Give me thy hand. Who's there?

81
	

III,4,1845
	

What art thou that dost grumble there i' th' straw?
Come forth.

82
	

III,4,1868
	

He hath no daughters, sir.

83
	

III,4,1919
	

How fares your Grace?

84
	

III,4,1921
	

Who's there? What is't you seek?

85
	

III,4,1948
	

Good my lord, take his offer; go into th' house.

86
	

III,4,1953
	

Importune him once more to go, my lord.
His wits begin t' unsettle.

87
	

III,4,1970
	

This way, my lord.

88
	

III,4,1973
	

Good my lord, soothe him; let him take the fellow.

89
	

III,4,1975
	

Sirrah, come on; go along with us.

90
	

III,6,2010
	

All the power of his wits have given way to his impatience.
The gods reward your kindness!

91
	

III,6,2037
	

How do you, sir? Stand you not so amaz'd.
Will you lie down and rest upon the cushions?

92
	

III,6,2060
	

O pity! Sir, where is the patience now
That you so oft have boasted to retain?

93
	

III,6,2082
	

Now, good my lord, lie here and rest awhile.

94
	

III,6,2088
	

Here, sir; but trouble him not; his wits are gone.

95
	

III,6,2099
	

Oppressed nature sleeps.
This rest might yet have balm'd thy broken senses,
Which, if convenience will not allow,
Stand in hard cure. [To the Fool] Come, help to bear thy master.
Thou must not stay behind.

96
	

IV,3,2454
	

Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back know you the
reason?

97
	

IV,3,2460
	

Who hath he left behind him general?

98
	

IV,3,2462
	

Did your letters pierce the Queen to any demonstration of
grief?

99
	

IV,3,2469
	

O, then it mov'd her?

100
	

IV,3,2479
	

Made she no verbal question?

101
	

IV,3,2488
	

It is the stars,
The stars above us, govern our conditions;
Else one self mate and mate could not beget
Such different issues. You spoke not with her since?

102
	

IV,3,2493
	

Was this before the King return'd?

103
	

IV,3,2495
	

Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear's i' th' town;
Who sometime, in his better tune, remembers
What we are come about, and by no means
Will yield to see his daughter.

104
	

IV,3,2500
	

A sovereign shame so elbows him; his own unkindness,
That stripp'd her from his benediction, turn'd her
To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights
To his dog-hearted daughters- these things sting
His mind so venomously that burning shame
Detains him from Cordelia.

105
	

IV,3,2507
	

Of Albany's and Cornwall's powers you heard not?

106
	

IV,3,2509
	

Well, sir, I'll bring you to our master Lear
And leave you to attend him. Some dear cause
Will in concealment wrap me up awhile.
When I am known aright, you shall not grieve
Lending me this acquaintance. I pray you go
Along with me. Exeunt.

107
	

IV,7,2913
	

To be acknowledg'd, madam, is o'erpaid.
All my reports go with the modest truth;
Nor more nor clipp'd, but so.

108
	

IV,7,2919
	

Pardon, dear madam.
Yet to be known shortens my made intent.
My boon I make it that you know me not
Till time and I think meet.

109
	

IV,7,2945
	

Kind and dear princess!

110
	

IV,7,2998
	

In your own kingdom, sir.

111
	

IV,7,3010
	

Most certain, sir.

112
	

IV,7,3012
	

As 'tis said, the bastard son of Gloucester.

113
	

IV,7,3015
	

Report is changeable. 'Tis time to look about; the powers of
the kingdom approach apace.

114
	

IV,7,3019
	

My point and period will be throughly wrought,
Or well or ill, as this day's battle's fought. Exit.

115
	

V,3,3404
	

I am come
To bid my king and master aye good night.
Is he not here?

116
	

V,3,3411
	

Alack, why thus?

117
	

V,3,3441
	

Is this the promis'd end?

118
	

V,3,3447
	

O my good master!

119
	

V,3,3462
	

If fortune brag of two she lov'd and hated,
One of them we behold.

120
	

V,3,3465
	

The same-
Your servant Kent. Where is your servant Caius?

121
	

V,3,3469
	

No, my good lord; I am the very man-

122
	

V,3,3471
	

That from your first of difference and decay
Have followed your sad steps.

123
	

V,3,3474
	

Nor no man else! All's cheerless, dark, and deadly.
Your eldest daughters have fordone themselves,
And desperately are dead.

124
	

V,3,3502
	

Break, heart; I prithee break!

125
	

V,3,3504
	

Vex not his ghost. O, let him pass! He hates him
That would upon the rack of this tough world
Stretch him out longer.

126
	

V,3,3508
	

The wonder is, he hath endur'd so long.
He but usurp'd his life.

127
	

V,3,3514
	

I have a journey, sir, shortly to go.
My master calls me; I must not say no.
