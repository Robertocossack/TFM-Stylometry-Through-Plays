I,1,183
	

Is the day so young?

2
	

I,1,185
	

Ay me! sad hours seem long.
Was that my father that went hence so fast?

3
	

I,1,188
	

Not having that, which, having, makes them short.

4
	

I,1,190
	

Out—

5
	

I,1,192
	

Out of her favour, where I am in love.

6
	

I,1,195
	

Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
O any thing, of nothing first create!
O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
sick health!
Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
Dost thou not laugh?

7
	

I,1,210
	

Good heart, at what?

8
	

I,1,212
	

Why, such is love's transgression.
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
What is it else? a madness most discreet,
A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
Farewell, my coz.

9
	

I,1,225
	

Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;
This is not Romeo, he's some other where.

10
	

I,1,228
	

What, shall I groan and tell thee?

11
	

I,1,231
	

Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.

12
	

I,1,235
	

A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.

13
	

I,1,237
	

Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
That when she dies with beauty dies her store.

14
	

I,1,247
	

She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
For beauty starved with her severity
Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
To merit bliss by making me despair:
She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
Do I live dead that live to tell it now.

15
	

I,1,255
	

O, teach me how I should forget to think.

16
	

I,1,258
	

'Tis the way
To call hers exquisite, in question more:
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
He that is strucken blind cannot forget
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.

17
	

I,2,325
	

Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.

18
	

I,2,327
	

For your broken shin.

19
	

I,2,329
	

Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;
Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
Whipp'd and tormented and—God-den, good fellow.

20
	

I,2,333
	

Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.

21
	

I,2,336
	

Ay, if I know the letters and the language.

22
	

I,2,338
	

Stay, fellow; I can read.
[Reads]
'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the lady
widow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and his lovely
nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine
uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair niece
Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin
Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.' A fair
assembly: whither should they come?

23
	

I,2,349
	

Whither?

24
	

I,2,351
	

Whose house?

25
	

I,2,353
	

Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before.

26
	

I,2,365
	

When the devout religion of mine eye
Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
And these, who often drown'd could never die,
Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun
Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.

27
	

I,2,377
	

I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.

28
	

I,4,497
	

What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
Or shall we on without a apology?

29
	

I,4,507
	

Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;
Being but heavy, I will bear the light.

30
	

I,4,510
	

Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes
With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.

31
	

I,4,515
	

I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.

32
	

I,4,521
	

Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.

33
	

I,4,531
	

A torch for me: let wantons light of heart
Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
I'll be a candle-holder, and look on.
The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.

34
	

I,4,540
	

Nay, that's not so.

35
	

I,4,545
	

And we mean well in going to this mask;
But 'tis no wit to go.

36
	

I,4,548
	

I dream'd a dream to-night.

37
	

I,4,550
	

Well, what was yours?

38
	

I,4,552
	

In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.

39
	

I,4,596
	

Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
Thou talk'st of nothing.

40
	

I,4,608
	

I fear, too early: for my mind misgives
Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
With this night's revels and expire the term
Of a despised life closed in my breast
By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
But He, that hath the steerage of my course,
Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.

41
	

I,5,662
	

[To a Servingman] What lady is that, which doth
enrich the hand
Of yonder knight?

42
	

I,5,666
	

O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;
Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,
And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.

43
	

I,5,719
	

[To JULIET] If I profane with my unworthiest hand
This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.

44
	

I,5,727
	

Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?

45
	

I,5,729
	

O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.

46
	

I,5,732
	

Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.
Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.

47
	

I,5,735
	

Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!
Give me my sin again.

48
	

I,5,739
	

What is her mother?

49
	

I,5,746
	

Is she a Capulet?
O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.

50
	

I,5,749
	

Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.

51
	

II,1,796
	

Can I go forward when my heart is here?
Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.

52
	

II,2,845
	

He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
[JULIET appears above at a window]
But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
Who is already sick and pale with grief,
That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
Be not her maid, since she is envious;
Her vestal livery is but sick and green
And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
It is my lady, O, it is my love!
O, that she knew she were!
She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
Having some business, do entreat her eyes
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
Would through the airy region stream so bright
That birds would sing and think it were not night.
See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
That I might touch that cheek!

53
	

II,2,872
	

She speaks:
O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
As glorious to this night, being o'er my head
As is a winged messenger of heaven
Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
And sails upon the bosom of the air.

54
	

II,2,884
	

[Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?

55
	

II,2,897
	

I take thee at thy word:
Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.

56
	

II,2,902
	

By a name
I know not how to tell thee who I am:
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
Because it is an enemy to thee;
Had I it written, I would tear the word.

57
	

II,2,910
	

Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.

58
	

II,2,915
	

With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
For stony limits cannot hold love out,
And what love can do that dares love attempt;
Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.

59
	

II,2,920
	

Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
And I am proof against their enmity.

60
	

II,2,924
	

I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
And but thou love me, let them find me here:
My life were better ended by their hate,
Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.

61
	

II,2,929
	

By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;
He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
I would adventure for such merchandise.

62
	

II,2,956
	

Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops—

63
	

II,2,961
	

What shall I swear by?

64
	

II,2,966
	

If my heart's dear love—

65
	

II,2,976
	

O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

66
	

II,2,978
	

The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.

67
	

II,2,981
	

Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?

68
	

II,2,992
	

O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.
Being in night, all this is but a dream,
Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.

69
	

II,2,1010
	

So thrive my soul—

70
	

II,2,1013
	

A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from
their books,
But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.

71
	

II,2,1025
	

It is my soul that calls upon my name:
How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
Like softest music to attending ears!

72
	

II,2,1029
	

My dear?

73
	

II,2,1032
	

At the hour of nine.

74
	

II,2,1035
	

Let me stand here till thou remember it.

75
	

II,2,1038
	

And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
Forgetting any other home but this.

76
	

II,2,1046
	

I would I were thy bird.

77
	

II,2,1053
	

Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.

78
	

II,3,1090
	

Good morrow, father.

79
	

II,3,1103
	

That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.

80
	

II,3,1105
	

With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;
I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.

81
	

II,3,1108
	

I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.
I have been feasting with mine enemy,
Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,
That's by me wounded: both our remedies
Within thy help and holy physic lies:
I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
My intercession likewise steads my foe.

82
	

II,3,1117
	

Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:
As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
And all combined, save what thou must combine
By holy marriage: when and where and how
We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,
I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
That thou consent to marry us to-day.

83
	

II,3,1141
	

Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.

84
	

II,3,1143
	

And bad'st me bury love.

85
	

II,3,1146
	

I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now
Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
The other did not so.

86
	

II,3,1155
	

O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.

87
	

II,4,1208
	

Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?

88
	

II,4,1210
	

Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in
such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.

89
	

II,4,1214
	

Meaning, to court'sy.

90
	

II,4,1216
	

A most courteous exposition.

91
	

II,4,1218
	

Pink for flower.

92
	

II,4,1220
	

Why, then is my pump well flowered.

93
	

II,4,1224
	

O single-soled jest, solely singular for the
singleness.

94
	

II,4,1227
	

Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match.

95
	

II,4,1232
	

Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast
not there for the goose.

96
	

II,4,1235
	

Nay, good goose, bite not.

97
	

II,4,1238
	

And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?

98
	

II,4,1241
	

I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added
to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.

99
	

II,4,1254
	

Here's goodly gear!

100
	

II,4,1269
	

One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to
mar.

101
	

II,4,1274
	

I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when
you have found him than he was when you sought him:
I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.

102
	

II,4,1284
	

What hast thou found?

103
	

II,4,1296
	

I will follow you.

104
	

II,4,1303
	

A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,
and will speak more in a minute than he will stand
to in a month.

105
	

II,4,1326
	

Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I
protest unto thee—

106
	

II,4,1330
	

What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.

107
	

II,4,1333
	

Bid her devise
Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.

108
	

II,4,1338
	

Go to; I say you shall.

109
	

II,4,1340
	

And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:
Within this hour my man shall be with thee
And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;
Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
Must be my convoy in the secret night.
Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:
Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.

110
	

II,4,1348
	

What say'st thou, my dear nurse?

111
	

II,4,1351
	

I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.

112
	

II,4,1361
	

Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R.

113
	

II,4,1367
	

Commend me to thy lady.

114
	

II,6,1461
	

Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
That one short minute gives me in her sight:
Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
Then love-devouring death do what he dare;
It is enough I may but call her mine.

115
	

II,6,1483
	

Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more
To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
Unfold the imagined happiness that both
Receive in either by this dear encounter.

116
	

III,1,1560
	

Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
To such a greeting: villain am I none;
Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.

117
	

III,1,1566
	

I do protest, I never injured thee,
But love thee better than thou canst devise,
Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
And so, good Capulet,—which name I tender
As dearly as my own,—be satisfied.

118
	

III,1,1584
	

Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.

119
	

III,1,1587
	

Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!
Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath
Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:
Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!

120
	

III,1,1600
	

Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.

121
	

III,1,1610
	

I thought all for the best.

122
	

III,1,1616
	

This gentleman, the prince's near ally,
My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
In my behalf; my reputation stain'd
With Tybalt's slander,—Tybalt, that an hour
Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,
Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!

123
	

III,1,1627
	

This day's black fate on more days doth depend;
This but begins the woe, others must end.

124
	

III,1,1630
	

Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!
Away to heaven, respective lenity,
And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!
[Re-enter TYBALT]
Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,
That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
Is but a little way above our heads,
Staying for thine to keep him company:
Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.

125
	

III,1,1641
	

This shall determine that.

126
	

III,1,1647
	

O, I am fortune's fool!

127
	

III,3,1874
	

Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?
What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
That I yet know not?

128
	

III,3,1880
	

What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?

129
	

III,3,1883
	

Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'
For exile hath more terror in his look,
Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'

130
	

III,3,1888
	

There is no world without Verona walls,
But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,
And world's exile is death: then banished,
Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,
Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,
And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.

131
	

III,3,1900
	

'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,
Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
Live here in heaven and may look on her;
But Romeo may not: more validity,
More honourable state, more courtship lives
In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize
On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
Who even in pure and vestal modesty,
Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
But Romeo may not; he is banished:
Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:
They are free men, but I am banished.
And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?
Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
But 'banished' to kill me?—'banished'?
O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,
Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
To mangle me with that word 'banished'?

132
	

III,3,1924
	

O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.

133
	

III,3,1928
	

Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.

134
	

III,3,1933
	

How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?

135
	

III,3,1935
	

Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:
Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
Doting like me and like me banished,
Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
Taking the measure of an unmade grave.

136
	

III,3,1944
	

Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes.

137
	

III,3,1969
	

Nurse!

138
	

III,3,1971
	

Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?
Doth she not think me an old murderer,
Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
With blood removed but little from her own?
Where is she? and how doth she? and what says
My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?

139
	

III,3,1981
	

As if that name,
Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand
Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
In what vile part of this anatomy
Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
The hateful mansion.

140
	

III,3,2043
	

Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.

141
	

III,3,2047
	

How well my comfort is revived by this!

142
	

III,3,2055
	

But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell.

143
	

III,5,2103
	

It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks
Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:
Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.

144
	

III,5,2114
	

Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;
I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
I have more care to stay than will to go:
Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.

145
	

III,5,2133
	

More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!

146
	

III,5,2141
	

Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.

147
	

III,5,2148
	

Farewell!
I will omit no opportunity
That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.

148
	

III,5,2152
	

I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
For sweet discourses in our time to come.

149
	

III,5,2158
	

And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:
Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!

150
	

V,1,2805
	

If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,
My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:
My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;
And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
I dreamt my lady came and found me dead—
Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave
to think!—
And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,
That I revived, and was an emperor.
Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
[Enter BALTHASAR, booted]
News from Verona!—How now, Balthasar!
Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
How doth my lady? Is my father well?
How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;
For nothing can be ill, if she be well.

151
	

V,1,2830
	

Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!
Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,
And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.

152
	

V,1,2836
	

Tush, thou art deceived:
Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?

153
	

V,1,2840
	

No matter: get thee gone,
And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.
[Exit BALTHASAR]
Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift
To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
I do remember an apothecary,—
And hereabouts he dwells,—which late I noted
In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,
Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,
Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
A beggarly account of empty boxes,
Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,
Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,
Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.
Noting this penury, to myself I said
'An if a man did need a poison now,
Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
O, this same thought did but forerun my need;
And this same needy man must sell it me.
As I remember, this should be the house.
Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.
What, ho! apothecary!

154
	

V,1,2869
	

Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:
Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have
A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
As will disperse itself through all the veins
That the life-weary taker may fall dead
And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
As violently as hasty powder fired
Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.

155
	

V,1,2879
	

Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;
The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;
The world affords no law to make thee rich;
Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.

156
	

V,1,2887
	

I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.

157
	

V,1,2891
	

There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
Doing more murders in this loathsome world,
Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.

158
	

V,3,2959
	

Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
Hold, take this letter; early in the morning
See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
Give me the light: upon thy life, I charge thee,
Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,
And do not interrupt me in my course.
Why I descend into this bed of death,
Is partly to behold my lady's face;
But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
A precious ring, a ring that I must use
In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:
But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
In what I further shall intend to do,
By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:
The time and my intents are savage-wild,
More fierce and more inexorable far
Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.

159
	

V,3,2978
	

So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that:
Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow.

160
	

V,3,2983
	

Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,
Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!

161
	

V,3,2998
	

I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;
Fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone;
Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
Put not another sin upon my head,
By urging me to fury: O, be gone!
By heaven, I love thee better than myself;
For I come hither arm'd against myself:
Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say,
A madman's mercy bade thee run away.

162
	

V,3,3010
	

Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!

163
	

V,3,3019
	

In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
What said my man, when my betossed soul
Did not attend him as we rode? I think
He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;
A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,
For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
This vault a feasting presence full of light.
Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
[Laying PARIS in the tomb]
How oft when men are at the point of death
Have they been merry! which their keepers call
A lightning before death: O, how may I
Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet
Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
O, what more favour can I do to thee,
Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
To sunder his that was thine enemy?
Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,
Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe
That unsubstantial death is amorous,
And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;
And never from this palace of dim night
Depart again: here, here will I remain
With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here
Will I set up my everlasting rest,
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!
Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
Here's to my love!
[Drinks]
O true apothecary!
Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.
[Dies]
[Enter, at the other end of the churchyard, FRIAR]

I,3,386
	

How now! who calls?

2
	

I,3,388
	

Madam, I am here.
What is your will?

3
	

I,3,443
	

And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.

4
	

I,3,451
	

It is an honour that I dream not of.

5
	

I,3,482
	

I'll look to like, if looking liking move:
But no more deep will I endart mine eye
Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.

6
	

I,5,723
	

Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.

7
	

I,5,728
	

Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.

8
	

I,5,731
	

Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.

9
	

I,5,734
	

Then have my lips the sin that they have took.

10
	

I,5,737
	

You kiss by the book.

11
	

I,5,758
	

Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?

12
	

I,5,760
	

What's he that now is going out of door?

13
	

I,5,762
	

What's he that follows there, that would not dance?

14
	

I,5,764
	

Go ask his name: if he be married.
My grave is like to be my wedding bed.

15
	

I,5,768
	

My only love sprung from my only hate!
Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
That I must love a loathed enemy.

16
	

I,5,773
	

A rhyme I learn'd even now
Of one I danced withal.

17
	

II,2,871
	

Ay me!

18
	

II,2,880
	

O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
And I'll no longer be a Capulet.

19
	

II,2,885
	

'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
What's in a name? that which we call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet;
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
Retain that dear perfection which he owes
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
And for that name which is no part of thee
Take all myself.

20
	

II,2,900
	

What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
So stumblest on my counsel?

21
	

II,2,907
	

My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?

22
	

II,2,911
	

How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
And the place death, considering who thou art,
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.

23
	

II,2,919
	

If they do see thee, they will murder thee.

24
	

II,2,923
	

I would not for the world they saw thee here.

25
	

II,2,928
	

By whose direction found'st thou out this place?

26
	

II,2,934
	

Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'
And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,
Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,
So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:
But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
I should have been more strange, I must confess,
But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
And not impute this yielding to light love,
Which the dark night hath so discovered.

27
	

II,2,958
	

O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
That monthly changes in her circled orb,
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.

28
	

II,2,962
	

Do not swear at all;
Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
Which is the god of my idolatry,
And I'll believe thee.

29
	

II,2,967
	

Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
I have no joy of this contract to-night:
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
Come to thy heart as that within my breast!

30
	

II,2,977
	

What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?

31
	

II,2,979
	

I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
And yet I would it were to give again.

32
	

II,2,982
	

But to be frank, and give it thee again.
And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
The more I have, for both are infinite.
[Nurse calls within]
I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!
Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
Stay but a little, I will come again.

33
	

II,2,996
	

Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
If that thy bent of love be honourable,
Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
And follow thee my lord throughout the world.

34
	

II,2,1004
	

I come, anon.—But if thou mean'st not well,
I do beseech thee—

35
	

II,2,1007
	

By and by, I come:—
To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:
To-morrow will I send.

36
	

II,2,1011
	

A thousand times good night!

37
	

II,2,1019
	

Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,
To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
With repetition of my Romeo's name.

38
	

II,2,1028
	

Romeo!

39
	

II,2,1030
	

At what o'clock to-morrow
Shall I send to thee?

40
	

II,2,1033
	

I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
I have forgot why I did call thee back.

41
	

II,2,1036
	

I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
Remembering how I love thy company.

42
	

II,2,1040
	

'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
So loving-jealous of his liberty.

43
	

II,2,1047
	

Sweet, so would I:
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
Good night, good night! parting is such
sweet sorrow,
That I shall say good night till it be morrow.

44
	

II,5,1375
	

The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
In half an hour she promised to return.
Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.
O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,
Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
Driving back shadows over louring hills:
Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,
And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
And his to me:
But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
O God, she comes!
[Enter Nurse and PETER]
O honey nurse, what news?
Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.

45
	

II,5,1398
	

Now, good sweet nurse,—O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
By playing it to me with so sour a face.

46
	

II,5,1404
	

I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.

47
	

II,5,1408
	

How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
To say to me that thou art out of breath?
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;
Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:
Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?

48
	

II,5,1423
	

No, no: but all this did I know before.
What says he of our marriage? what of that?

49
	

II,5,1430
	

I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?

50
	

II,5,1435
	

Where is my mother! why, she is within;
Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
Where is your mother?'

51
	

II,5,1443
	

Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?

52
	

II,5,1445
	

I have.

53
	

II,5,1456
	

Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.

54
	

II,6,1480
	

Good even to my ghostly confessor.

55
	

II,6,1482
	

As much to him, else is his thanks too much.

56
	

II,6,1489
	

Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
Brags of his substance, not of ornament:
They are but beggars that can count their worth;
But my true love is grown to such excess
I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.

57
	

III,2,1719
	

Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner
As Phaethon would whip you to the west,
And bring in cloudy night immediately.
Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo
Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
And learn me how to lose a winning match,
Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
Think true love acted simple modesty.
Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,
Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
Take him and cut him out in little stars,
And he will make the face of heaven so fine
That all the world will be in love with night
And pay no worship to the garish sun.
O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
As is the night before some festival
To an impatient child that hath new robes
And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
[Enter Nurse, with cords]
Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
That Romeo bid thee fetch?

58
	

III,2,1757
	

Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?

59
	

III,2,1761
	

Can heaven be so envious?

60
	

III,2,1765
	

What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'
And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
I am not I, if there be such an I;
Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'
If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:
Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.

61
	

III,2,1779
	

O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!
To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!
Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!

62
	

III,2,1786
	

What storm is this that blows so contrary?
Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?
Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
For who is living, if those two are gone?

63
	

III,2,1793
	

O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?

64
	

III,2,1795
	

O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
Despised substance of divinest show!
Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,
A damned saint, an honourable villain!
O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,
When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?
Was ever book containing such vile matter
So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell
In such a gorgeous palace!

65
	

III,2,1814
	

Blister'd be thy tongue
For such a wish! he was not born to shame:
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
Sole monarch of the universal earth.
O, what a beast was I to chide at him!

66
	

III,2,1821
	

Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:
Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;
Your tributary drops belong to woe,
Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:
All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;
But, O, it presses to my memory,
Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo—banished;'
That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
Was woe enough, if it had ended there:
Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
Which modern lamentations might have moved?
But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,
'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,
Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'
There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?

67
	

III,2,1854
	

Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,
When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,
Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:
He made you for a highway to my bed;
But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;
And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!

68
	

III,2,1866
	

O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,
And bid him come to take his last farewell.

69
	

III,5,2098
	

Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:
It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;
Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:
Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.

70
	

III,5,2109
	

Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:
It is some meteor that the sun exhales,
To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,
And light thee on thy way to Mantua:
Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.

71
	

III,5,2123
	

It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!
It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
Some say the lark makes sweet division;
This doth not so, for she divideth us:
Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,
O, now I would they had changed voices too!
Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,
O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.

72
	

III,5,2136
	

Nurse?

73
	

III,5,2140
	

Then, window, let day in, and let life out.

74
	

III,5,2143
	

Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!
I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
For in a minute there are many days:
O, by this count I shall be much in years
Ere I again behold my Romeo!

75
	

III,5,2151
	

O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?

76
	

III,5,2154
	

O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:
Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.

77
	

III,5,2161
	

O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:
If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.
That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;
For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,
But send him back.

78
	

III,5,2167
	

Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?
Is she not down so late, or up so early?
What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?

79
	

III,5,2172
	

Madam, I am not well.

80
	

III,5,2178
	

Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.

81
	

III,5,2181
	

Feeling so the loss,
Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.

82
	

III,5,2185
	

What villain madam?

83
	

III,5,2187
	

[Aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.—
God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.

84
	

III,5,2191
	

Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:
Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!

85
	

III,5,2199
	

Indeed, I never shall be satisfied
With Romeo, till I behold him—dead—
Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.
Madam, if you could find out but a man
To bear a poison, I would temper it;
That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
To hear him named, and cannot come to him.
To wreak the love I bore my cousin
Upon his body that slaughter'd him!

86
	

III,5,2211
	

And joy comes well in such a needy time:
What are they, I beseech your ladyship?

87
	

III,5,2217
	

Madam, in happy time, what day is that?

88
	

III,5,2222
	

Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,
He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
I wonder at this haste; that I must wed
Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,
It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!

89
	

III,5,2253
	

Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:
Proud can I never be of what I hate;
But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.

90
	

III,5,2266
	

Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
Hear me with patience but to speak a word.

91
	

III,5,2311
	

Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
That sees into the bottom of my grief?
O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!
Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.

92
	

III,5,2320
	

O God!—O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;
How shall that faith return again to earth,
Unless that husband send it me from heaven
By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.
Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
Upon so soft a subject as myself!
What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
Some comfort, nurse.

93
	

III,5,2343
	

Speakest thou from thy heart?

94
	

III,5,2346
	

Amen!

95
	

III,5,2348
	

Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,
Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,
To make confession and to be absolved.

96
	

III,5,2354
	

Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
Which she hath praised him with above compare
So many thousand times? Go, counsellor;
Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:
If all else fail, myself have power to die.

97
	

IV,1,2383
	

That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.

98
	

IV,1,2385
	

What must be shall be.

99
	

IV,1,2388
	

To answer that, I should confess to you.

100
	

IV,1,2390
	

I will confess to you that I love him.

101
	

IV,1,2392
	

If I do so, it will be of more price,
Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.

102
	

IV,1,2395
	

The tears have got small victory by that;
For it was bad enough before their spite.

103
	

IV,1,2398
	

That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
And what I spake, I spake it to my face.

104
	

IV,1,2401
	

It may be so, for it is not mine own.
Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
Or shall I come to you at evening mass?

105
	

IV,1,2410
	

O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!

106
	

IV,1,2416
	

Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
Do thou but call my resolution wise,
And with this knife I'll help it presently.
God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
Shall be the label to another deed,
Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
Turn to another, this shall slay them both:
Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,
Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
Which the commission of thy years and art
Could to no issue of true honour bring.
Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.

107
	

IV,1,2443
	

O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
From off the battlements of yonder tower;
Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
Or bid me go into a new-made grave
And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;
And I will do it without fear or doubt,
To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.

108
	

IV,1,2487
	

Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!

109
	

IV,1,2491
	

Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
Farewell, dear father!

110
	

IV,2,2514
	

Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin
Of disobedient opposition
To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,
And beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you!
Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.

111
	

IV,2,2522
	

I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;
And gave him what becomed love I might,
Not step o'er the bounds of modesty.

112
	

IV,2,2530
	

Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
To help me sort such needful ornaments
As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?

113
	

IV,3,2549
	

Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse,
I pray thee, leave me to myself to-night,
For I have need of many orisons
To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
Which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin.

114
	

IV,3,2556
	

No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:
So please you, let me now be left alone,
And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
For, I am sure, you have your hands full all,
In this so sudden business.

115
	

IV,3,2565
	

Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,
That almost freezes up the heat of life:
I'll call them back again to comfort me:
Nurse! What should she do here?
My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
Come, vial.
What if this mixture do not work at all?
Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.
[Laying down her dagger]
What if it be a poison, which the friar
Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,
Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,
Because he married me before to Romeo?
I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,
For he hath still been tried a holy man.
How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
I wake before the time that Romeo
Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!
Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,
To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
Or, if I live, is it not very like,
The horrible conceit of death and night,
Together with the terror of the place,—
As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
Where, for these many hundred years, the bones
Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
At some hours in the night spirits resort;—
Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,
That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:—
O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
Environed with all these hideous fears?
And madly play with my forefather's joints?
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!
Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.

116
	

V,3,3107
	

O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
I do remember well where I should be,
And there I am. Where is my Romeo?

117
	

V,3,3122
	

Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
[Exit FRIAR LAURENCE]
What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?
Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:
O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
To help me after? I will kiss thy lips;
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
To make die with a restorative.
[Kisses him]
Thy lips are warm.

118
	

V,3,3133
	

Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!
[Snatching ROMEO's dagger]
This is thy sheath;
[Stabs herself]
there rust, and let me die.

1
	

I,1,76
	

Part, fools!
Put up your swords; you know not what you do.

2
	

I,1,82
	

I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
Or manage it to part these men with me.

3
	

I,1,127
	

Here were the servants of your adversary,
And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
I drew to part them: in the instant came
The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
He swung about his head and cut the winds,
Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
Came more and more and fought on part and part,
Till the prince came, who parted either part.

4
	

I,1,139
	

Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
That westward rooteth from the city's side,
So early walking did I see your son:
Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
And stole into the covert of the wood:
I, measuring his affections by my own,
That most are busied when they're most alone,
Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.

5
	

I,1,163
	

My noble uncle, do you know the cause?

6
	

I,1,165
	

Have you importuned him by any means?

7
	

I,1,177
	

See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.

8
	

I,1,182
	

Good-morrow, cousin.

9
	

I,1,184
	

But new struck nine.

10
	

I,1,187
	

It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?

11
	

I,1,189
	

In love?

12
	

I,1,191
	

Of love?

13
	

I,1,193
	

Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!

14
	

I,1,209
	

No, coz, I rather weep.

15
	

I,1,211
	

At thy good heart's oppression.

16
	

I,1,223
	

Soft! I will go along;
An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.

17
	

I,1,227
	

Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.

18
	

I,1,229
	

Groan! why, no.
But sadly tell me who.

19
	

I,1,234
	

I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.

20
	

I,1,236
	

A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.

21
	

I,1,246
	

Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?

22
	

I,1,254
	

Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.

23
	

I,1,256
	

By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
Examine other beauties.

24
	

I,1,268
	

I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.

25
	

I,2,319
	

Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,
One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
And the rank poison of the old will die.

26
	

I,2,326
	

For what, I pray thee?

27
	

I,2,328
	

Why, Romeo, art thou mad?

28
	

I,2,359
	

At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest,
With all the admired beauties of Verona:
Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,
Compare her face with some that I shall show,
And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.

29
	

I,2,371
	

Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
Herself poised with herself in either eye:
But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
Your lady's love against some other maid
That I will show you shining at this feast,
And she shall scant show well that now shows best.

30
	

I,4,499
	

The date is out of such prolixity:
We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
After the prompter, for our entrance:
But let them measure us by what they will;
We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.

31
	

I,4,529
	

Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,
But every man betake him to his legs.

32
	

I,4,606
	

This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;
Supper is done, and we shall come too late.

33
	

I,4,616
	

Strike, drum.

34
	

I,5,748
	

Away, begone; the sport is at the best.

35
	

II,1,800
	

Romeo! my cousin Romeo!

36
	

II,1,803
	

He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:
Call, good Mercutio.

37
	

II,1,821
	

And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.

38
	

II,1,829
	

Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,
To be consorted with the humorous night:
Blind is his love and best befits the dark.

39
	

II,1,841
	

Go, then; for 'tis in vain
To seek him here that means not to be found.

40
	

II,4,1161
	

Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.

41
	

II,4,1164
	

Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,
Hath sent a letter to his father's house.

42
	

II,4,1167
	

Romeo will answer it.

43
	

II,4,1169
	

Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he
dares, being dared.

44
	

II,4,1176
	

Why, what is Tybalt?

45
	

II,4,1186
	

The what?

46
	

II,4,1197
	

Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.

47
	

II,4,1248
	

Stop there, stop there.

48
	

II,4,1250
	

Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.

49
	

II,4,1257
	

Two, two; a shirt and a smock.

50
	

II,4,1282
	

She will indite him to some supper.

51
	

III,1,1499
	

I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:
The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;
For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.

52
	

III,1,1508
	

Am I like such a fellow?

53
	

III,1,1512
	

And what to?

54
	

III,1,1529
	

An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man
should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.

55
	

III,1,1532
	

By my head, here come the Capulets.

56
	

III,1,1547
	

We talk here in the public haunt of men:
Either withdraw unto some private place,
And reason coldly of your grievances,
Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.

57
	

III,1,1596
	

What, art thou hurt?

58
	

III,1,1624
	

O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,
Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.

59
	

III,1,1629
	

Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.

60
	

III,1,1643
	

Romeo, away, be gone!
The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,
If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!

61
	

III,1,1648
	

Why dost thou stay?

62
	

III,1,1653
	

There lies that Tybalt.

63
	

III,1,1659
	

O noble prince, I can discover all
The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:
There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.

64
	

III,1,1669
	

Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;
Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal
Your high displeasure: all this uttered
With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
Cold death aside, and with the other sends
It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than
his tongue,
His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
But by and by comes back to Romeo,
Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I
Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.
And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.

I,4,509
	

Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.

2
	

I,4,513
	

You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
And soar with them above a common bound.

3
	

I,4,519
	

And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
Too great oppression for a tender thing.

4
	

I,4,523
	

If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
Give me a case to put my visage in:
A visor for a visor! what care I
What curious eye doth quote deformities?
Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.

5
	

I,4,536
	

Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:
If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!

6
	

I,4,541
	

I mean, sir, in delay
We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
Five times in that ere once in our five wits.

7
	

I,4,547
	

Why, may one ask?

8
	

I,4,549
	

And so did I.

9
	

I,4,551
	

That dreamers often lie.

10
	

I,4,553
	

O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
On the fore-finger of an alderman,
Drawn with a team of little atomies
Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,
The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
The traces of the smallest spider's web,
The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,
Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
Not so big as a round little worm
Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
And in this state she gallops night by night
Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,
O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,
O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,
Then dreams, he of another benefice:
Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon
Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
That plats the manes of horses in the night,
And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,
Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
That presses them and learns them first to bear,
Making them women of good carriage:
This is she—

11
	

I,4,598
	

True, I talk of dreams,
Which are the children of an idle brain,
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
Which is as thin of substance as the air
And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.

12
	

II,1,801
	

He is wise;
And, on my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed.

13
	

II,1,805
	

Nay, I'll conjure too.
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:
Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;'
Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
One nick-name for her purblind son and heir,
Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!
He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,
By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh
And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
That in thy likeness thou appear to us!

14
	

II,1,822
	

This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him
To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
Till she had laid it and conjured it down;
That were some spite: my invocation
Is fair and honest, and in his mistress' name
I conjure only but to raise up him.

15
	

II,1,832
	

If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.
Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!
Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;
This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:
Come, shall we go?

16
	

II,4,1159
	

Where the devil should this Romeo be?
Came he not home to-night?

17
	

II,4,1162
	

Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline.
Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.

18
	

II,4,1166
	

A challenge, on my life.

19
	

II,4,1168
	

Any man that can write may answer a letter.

20
	

II,4,1171
	

Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a
white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a
love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the
blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to
encounter Tybalt?

21
	

II,4,1177
	

More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is
the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as
you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and
proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and
the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk
button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the
very first house, of the first and second cause:
ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the
hai!

22
	

II,4,1187
	

The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting
fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,
a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good
whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with
these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these
perdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form,
that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their
bones, their bones!

23
	

II,4,1198
	

Without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh,
how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers
that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a
kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to
be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy;
Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey
eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior
Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation
to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
fairly last night.

24
	

II,4,1209
	

The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?

25
	

II,4,1212
	

That's as much as to say, such a case as yours
constrains a man to bow in the hams.

26
	

II,4,1215
	

Thou hast most kindly hit it.

27
	

II,4,1217
	

Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.

28
	

II,4,1219
	

Right.

29
	

II,4,1221
	

Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast
worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it
is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular.

30
	

II,4,1226
	

Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.

31
	

II,4,1228
	

Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have
done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of
thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five:
was I with you there for the goose?

32
	

II,4,1234
	

I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.

33
	

II,4,1236
	

Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most
sharp sauce.

34
	

II,4,1239
	

O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an
inch narrow to an ell broad!

35
	

II,4,1243
	

Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?
now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art
thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:
for this drivelling love is like a great natural,
that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.

36
	

II,4,1249
	

Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.

37
	

II,4,1251
	

O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short:
for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and
meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer.

38
	

II,4,1256
	

A sail, a sail!

39
	

II,4,1261
	

Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the
fairer face.

40
	

II,4,1264
	

God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.

41
	

II,4,1266
	

'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the
dial is now upon the prick of noon.

42
	

II,4,1278
	

Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith;
wisely, wisely.

43
	

II,4,1283
	

A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!

44
	

II,4,1285
	

No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie,
that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.
[Sings]
An old hare hoar,
And an old hare hoar,
Is very good meat in lent
But a hare that is hoar
Is too much for a score,
When it hoars ere it be spent.
Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll
to dinner, thither.

45
	

II,4,1297
	

Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
[Singing]
'lady, lady, lady.'

46
	

III,1,1503
	

Thou art like one of those fellows that when he
enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
upon the table and says 'God send me no need of
thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws
it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.

47
	

III,1,1509
	

Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as
any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as
soon moody to be moved.

48
	

III,1,1513
	

Nay, an there were two such, we should have none
shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,
thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,
or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou
wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what
eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as
an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a
man for coughing in the street, because he hath
wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:
didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing
his new doublet before Easter? with another, for
tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou
wilt tutor me from quarrelling!

49
	

III,1,1531
	

The fee-simple! O simple!

50
	

III,1,1533
	

By my heel, I care not.

51
	

III,1,1537
	

And but one word with one of us? couple it with
something; make it a word and a blow.

52
	

III,1,1541
	

Could you not take some occasion without giving?

53
	

III,1,1543
	

Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an
thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but
discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall
make you dance. 'Zounds, consort!

54
	

III,1,1551
	

Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;
I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.

55
	

III,1,1555
	

But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:
Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;
Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'

56
	

III,1,1571
	

O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
Alla stoccata carries it away.
[Draws]
Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?

57
	

III,1,1576
	

Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine
lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you
shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the
eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher
by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your
ears ere it be out.

58
	

III,1,1585
	

Come, sir, your passado.

59
	

III,1,1593
	

I am hurt.
A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
Is he gone, and hath nothing?

60
	

III,1,1597
	

Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.
Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.

61
	

III,1,1601
	

No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a
church-door; but 'tis enough,'twill serve: ask for
me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I
am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'
both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a
cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a
rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I
was hurt under your arm.

62
	

III,1,1611
	

Help me into some house, Benvolio,
Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,
And soundly too: your houses!

1
	

I,3,382
	

Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird!
God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!

2
	

I,3,387
	

Your mother.

3
	

I,3,394
	

Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.

4
	

I,3,396
	

I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,—
And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four—
She is not fourteen. How long is it now
To Lammas-tide?

5
	

I,3,401
	

Even or odd, of all days in the year,
Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
Susan and she—God rest all Christian souls!—
Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;
She was too good for me: but, as I said,
On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
And she was wean'd,—I never shall forget it,—
Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
My lord and you were then at Mantua:—
Nay, I do bear a brain:—but, as I said,
When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,
To bid me trudge:
And since that time it is eleven years;
For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,
She could have run and waddled all about;
For even the day before, she broke her brow:
And then my husband—God be with his soul!
A' was a merry man—took up the child:
'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'
To see, now, how a jest shall come about!
I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,
I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'

6
	

I,3,435
	

Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:
'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?
Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'

7
	

I,3,444
	

Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:
An I might live to see thee married once,
I have my wish.

8
	

I,3,452
	

An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.

9
	

I,3,460
	

A man, young lady! lady, such a man
As all the world—why, he's a man of wax.

10
	

I,3,463
	

Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.

11
	

I,3,480
	

No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.

12
	

I,3,493
	

Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.

13
	

I,5,738
	

Madam, your mother craves a word with you.

14
	

I,5,740
	

Marry, bachelor,
Her mother is the lady of the house,
And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous
I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;
I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
Shall have the chinks.

15
	

I,5,759
	

The son and heir of old Tiberio.

16
	

I,5,761
	

Marry, that, I think, be young Petrucio.

17
	

I,5,763
	

I know not.

18
	

I,5,766
	

His name is Romeo, and a Montague;
The only son of your great enemy.

19
	

I,5,772
	

What's this? what's this?

20
	

I,5,776
	

Anon, anon!
Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.

21
	

II,2,1003
	

[Within] Madam!

22
	

II,2,1006
	

[Within] Madam!

23
	

II,4,1258
	

Peter!

24
	

II,4,1260
	

My fan, Peter.

25
	

II,4,1263
	

God ye good morrow, gentlemen.

26
	

II,4,1265
	

Is it good den?

27
	

II,4,1268
	

Out upon you! what a man are you!

28
	

II,4,1271
	

By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,'
quoth a'? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I
may find the young Romeo?

29
	

II,4,1277
	

You say well.

30
	

II,4,1280
	

if you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with
you.

31
	

II,4,1301
	

Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy
merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?

32
	

II,4,1306
	

An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him
down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such
Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall.
Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am
none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by
too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?

33
	

II,4,1316
	

Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about
me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word:
and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you
out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself:
but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into
a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross
kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman
is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double
with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered
to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.

34
	

II,4,1328
	

Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much:
Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.

35
	

II,4,1331
	

I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as
I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.

36
	

II,4,1337
	

No truly sir; not a penny.

37
	

II,4,1339
	

This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.

38
	

II,4,1347
	

Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.

39
	

II,4,1349
	

Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
Two may keep counsel, putting one away?

40
	

II,4,1352
	

Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady—Lord,
Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing:—O, there
is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain
lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief
see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her
sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer
man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks
as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not
rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?

41
	

II,4,1362
	

Ah. mocker! that's the dog's name; R is for
the—No; I know it begins with some other
letter:—and she hath the prettiest sententious of
it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good
to hear it.

42
	

II,4,1368
	

Ay, a thousand times.
[Exit Romeo]
Peter!

43
	

II,4,1372
	

Peter, take my fan, and go before and apace.

44
	

II,5,1396
	

Peter, stay at the gate.

45
	

II,5,1402
	

I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:
Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!

46
	

II,5,1406
	

Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?
Do you not see that I am out of breath?

47
	

II,5,1415
	

Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not
how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his
face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels
all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
though they be not to be talked on, yet they are
past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,
but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy
ways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at home?

48
	

II,5,1425
	

Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!
It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
My back o' t' other side,—O, my back, my back!
Beshrew your heart for sending me about,
To catch my death with jaunting up and down!

49
	

II,5,1432
	

Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a
courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I
warrant, a virtuous,—Where is your mother?

50
	

II,5,1439
	

O God's lady dear!
Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;
Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
Henceforward do your messages yourself.

51
	

II,5,1444
	

Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?

52
	

II,5,1446
	

Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
There stays a husband to make you a wife:
Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
Hie you to church; I must another way,
To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
I am the drudge and toil in your delight,
But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.

53
	

III,2,1755
	

Ay, ay, the cords.

54
	

III,2,1758
	

Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
We are undone, lady, we are undone!
Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!

55
	

III,2,1762
	

Romeo can,
Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!
Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!

56
	

III,2,1774
	

I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,—
God save the mark!—here on his manly breast:
A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.

57
	

III,2,1783
	

O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
That ever I should live to see thee dead!

58
	

III,2,1791
	

Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.

59
	

III,2,1794
	

It did, it did; alas the day, it did!

60
	

III,2,1808
	

There's no trust,
No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,
All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae:
These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
Shame come to Romeo!

61
	

III,2,1820
	

Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?

62
	

III,2,1852
	

Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:
Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.

63
	

III,2,1862
	

Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo
To comfort you: I wot well where he is.
Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:
I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.

64
	

III,3,1954
	

[Within] Let me come in, and you shall know
my errand;
I come from Lady Juliet.

65
	

III,3,1959
	

O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,
Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?

66
	

III,3,1962
	

O, he is even in my mistress' case,
Just in her case! O woful sympathy!
Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,
Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:
For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;
Why should you fall into so deep an O?

67
	

III,3,1970
	

Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.

68
	

III,3,1977
	

O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,
And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
And then down falls again.

69
	

III,3,2040
	

O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!
My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.

70
	

III,3,2044
	

Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:
Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.

71
	

III,5,2135
	

Madam!

III,5,2137
	

Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:
The day is broke; be wary, look about.

73
	

III,5,2277
	

God in heaven bless her!
You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.

74
	

III,5,2281
	

I speak no treason.

75
	

III,5,2283
	

May not one speak?

76
	

III,5,2329
	

Faith, here it is.
Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,
That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
I think it best you married with the county.
O, he's a lovely gentleman!
Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,
Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
I think you are happy in this second match,
For it excels your first: or if it did not,
Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,
As living here and you no use of him.

77
	

III,5,2344
	

And from my soul too;
Or else beshrew them both.

78
	

III,5,2347
	

What?

79
	

III,5,2352
	

Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.

80
	

IV,2,2508
	

Ay, forsooth.

81
	

IV,2,2511
	

See where she comes from shrift with merry look.

82
	

IV,4,2614
	

They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.

83
	

IV,4,2620
	

Go, you cot-quean, go,
Get you to bed; faith, You'll be sick to-morrow
For this night's watching.

84
	

IV,5,2653
	

Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! fast, I warrant her, she:
Why, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug-a-bed!
Why, love, I say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride!
What, not a word? you take your pennyworths now;
Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
The County Paris hath set up his rest,
That you shall rest but little. God forgive me,
Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep!
I must needs wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
Ay, let the county take you in your bed;
He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?
[Undraws the curtains]
What, dress'd! and in your clothes! and down again!
I must needs wake you; Lady! lady! lady!
Alas, alas! Help, help! my lady's dead!
O, well-a-day, that ever I was born!
Some aqua vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!

85
	

IV,5,2672
	

O lamentable day!

86
	

IV,5,2674
	

Look, look! O heavy day!

87
	

IV,5,2680
	

She's dead, deceased, she's dead; alack the day!

88
	

IV,5,2687
	

O lamentable day!

89
	

IV,5,2708
	

O woe! O woful, woful, woful day!
Most lamentable day, most woful day,
That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
Never was seen so black a day as this:
O woful day, O woful day!

90
	

IV,5,2757
	

Honest goodfellows, ah, put up, put up;
For, well you know, this is a pitiful case.

1
	

I,1,93
	

What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!

2
	

I,1,95
	

My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
And flourishes his blade in spite of me.

3
	

I,2,271
	

But Montague is bound as well as I,
In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
For men so old as we to keep the peace.

4
	

I,2,277
	

But saying o'er what I have said before:
My child is yet a stranger in the world;
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,
Let two more summers wither in their pride,
Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.

5
	

I,2,283
	

And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,
She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
My will to her consent is but a part;
An she agree, within her scope of choice
Lies my consent and fair according voice.
This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
Whereto I have invited many a guest,
Such as I love; and you, among the store,
One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
At my poor house look to behold this night
Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
When well-apparell'd April on the heel
Of limping winter treads, even such delight
Among fresh female buds shall you this night
Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,
And like her most whose merit most shall be:
Which on more view, of many mine being one
May stand in number, though in reckoning none,
Come, go with me.
[To Servant, giving a paper]
Go, sirrah, trudge about
Through fair Verona; find those persons out
Whose names are written there, and to them say,
My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.

6
	

I,5,634
	

Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes
Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you.
Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,
She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?
Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
That I have worn a visor and could tell
A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:
You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.
A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
[Music plays, and they dance]
More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;
For you and I are past our dancing days:
How long is't now since last yourself and I
Were in a mask?

7
	

I,5,654
	

What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much:
'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio,
Come pentecost as quickly as it will,
Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.

8
	

I,5,660
	

Will you tell me that?
His son was but a ward two years ago.

9
	

I,5,682
	

Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?

10
	

I,5,686
	

Young Romeo is it?

11
	

I,5,688
	

Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;
He bears him like a portly gentleman;
And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:
I would not for the wealth of all the town
Here in my house do him disparagement:
Therefore be patient, take no note of him:
It is my will, the which if thou respect,
Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.

12
	

I,5,700
	

He shall be endured:
What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;
Am I the master here, or you? go to.
You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!
You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!

13
	

I,5,707
	

Go to, go to;
You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?
This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:
You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.
Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:
Be quiet, or—More light, more light! For shame!
I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!

14
	

I,5,750
	

Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all
I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
More torches here! Come on then, let's to bed.
Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late:
I'll to my rest.

15
	

III,4,2059
	

Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,
That we have had no time to move our daughter:
Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
And so did I:—Well, we were born to die.
'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:
I promise you, but for your company,
I would have been a-bed an hour ago.

16
	

III,4,2070
	

Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled
In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.
Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;
And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next—
But, soft! what day is this?

17
	

III,4,2078
	

Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,
O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,
She shall be married to this noble earl.
Will you be ready? do you like this haste?
We'll keep no great ado,—a friend or two;
For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
It may be thought we held him carelessly,
Being our kinsman, if we revel much:
Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?

18
	

III,4,2089
	

Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then.
Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,
Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.
Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!
Afore me! it is so very very late,
That we may call it early by and by.
Good night.

19
	

III,5,2233
	

When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
But for the sunset of my brother's son
It rains downright.
How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?
Evermore showering? In one little body
Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;
For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;
Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,
Without a sudden calm, will overset
Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!
Have you deliver'd to her our decree?

20
	

III,5,2248
	

Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,
Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?

21
	

III,5,2256
	

How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?
'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'
And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,
Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,
But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,
To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!
You tallow-face!

22
	

III,5,2268
	

Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,
Or never after look me in the face:
Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;
My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
That God had lent us but this only child;
But now I see this one is one too much,
And that we have a curse in having her:
Out on her, hilding!

23
	

III,5,2279
	

And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,
Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.

24
	

III,5,2282
	

O, God ye god-den.

25
	

III,5,2284
	

Peace, you mumbling fool!
Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;
For here we need it not.

26
	

III,5,2288
	

God's bread! it makes me mad:
Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,
Alone, in company, still my care hath been
To have her match'd: and having now provided
A gentleman of noble parentage,
Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;
And then to have a wretched puling fool,
A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,
I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'
But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you:
Graze where you will you shall not house with me:
Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.
Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in
the streets,
For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.

27
	

IV,2,2495
	

So many guests invite as here are writ.
[Exit First Servant]
Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.

28
	

IV,2,2500
	

How canst thou try them so?

29
	

IV,2,2504
	

Go, be gone.
[Exit Second Servant]
We shall be much unfurnished for this time.
What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?

30
	

IV,2,2509
	

Well, he may chance to do some good on her:
A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.

31
	

IV,2,2513
	

How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?

32
	

IV,2,2520
	

Send for the county; go tell him of this:
I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.

33
	

IV,2,2525
	

Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:
This is as't should be. Let me see the county;
Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,
Our whole city is much bound to him.

34
	

IV,2,2534
	

Go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow.

35
	

IV,2,2538
	

Tush, I will stir about,
And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:
Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;
I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;
I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself
To County Paris, to prepare him up
Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,
Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.

36
	

IV,4,2616
	

Come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow'd,
The curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock:
Look to the baked meats, good Angelica:
Spare not for the cost.

37
	

IV,4,2623
	

No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now
All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.

38
	

IV,4,2628
	

A jealous hood, a jealous hood!

39
	

IV,4,2630
	

Now, fellow,
What's there?

40
	

IV,4,2633
	

Make haste, make haste.
[Exit First Servant]
Sirrah, fetch drier logs:
Call Peter, he will show thee where they are.

41
	

IV,4,2640
	

Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
Thou shalt be logger-head. Good faith, 'tis day:
The county will be here with music straight,
For so he said he would: I hear him near.
[Music within]
Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!
[Re-enter Nurse]
Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up;
I'll go and chat with Paris: hie, make haste,
Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already:
Make haste, I say.

42
	

IV,5,2679
	

For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.

43
	

IV,5,2682
	

Ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's cold:
Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
Life and these lips have long been separated:
Death lies on her like an untimely frost
Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.

44
	

IV,5,2689
	

Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
Ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak.

45
	

IV,5,2693
	

Ready to go, but never to return.
O son! the night before thy wedding-day
Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,
Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
My daughter he hath wedded: I will die,
And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's.

46
	

IV,5,2718
	

Despised, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now
To murder, murder our solemnity?
O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
Dead art thou! Alack! my child is dead;
And with my child my joys are buried.

47
	

IV,5,2743
	

All things that we ordained festival,
Turn from their office to black funeral;
Our instruments to melancholy bells,
Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,
Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
And all things change them to the contrary.

48
	

V,3,3163
	

What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?

49
	

V,3,3175
	

O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
This dagger hath mista'en—for, lo, his house
Is empty on the back of Montague,—
And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!

50
	

V,3,3271
	

O brother Montague, give me thy hand:
This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
Can I demand.

51
	

V,3,3279
	

As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
Poor sacrifices of our enmity!

I,1,94
	

A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?

2
	

I,3,381
	

Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.

3
	

I,3,390
	

This is the matter:—Nurse, give leave awhile,
We must talk in secret:—nurse, come back again;
I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.
Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.

4
	

I,3,395
	

She's not fourteen.

5
	

I,3,400
	

A fortnight and odd days.

6
	

I,3,434
	

Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.

7
	

I,3,448
	

Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
How stands your disposition to be married?

8
	

I,3,454
	

Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
Are made already mothers: by my count,
I was your mother much upon these years
That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.

9
	

I,3,462
	

Verona's summer hath not such a flower.

10
	

I,3,464
	

What say you? can you love the gentleman?
This night you shall behold him at our feast;
Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
Examine every married lineament,
And see how one another lends content
And what obscured in this fair volume lies
Find written in the margent of his eyes.
This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
For fair without the fair within to hide:
That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
So shall you share all that he doth possess,
By having him, making yourself no less.

11
	

I,3,481
	

Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?

12
	

I,3,490
	

We follow thee.
[Exit Servant]
Juliet, the county stays.

13
	

III,1,1663
	

Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt
O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.
O cousin, cousin!

14
	

III,1,1694
	

He is a kinsman to the Montague;
Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
And all those twenty could but kill one life.
I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.

15
	

III,4,2068
	

I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.

16
	

III,5,2166
	

[Within] Ho, daughter! are you up?

17
	

III,5,2171
	

Why, how now, Juliet!

18
	

III,5,2173
	

Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;
Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;
But much of grief shows still some want of wit.

19
	

III,5,2179
	

So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
Which you weep for.

20
	

III,5,2183
	

Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,
As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.

21
	

III,5,2186
	

That same villain, Romeo.

22
	

III,5,2190
	

That is, because the traitor murderer lives.

23
	

III,5,2193
	

We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:
Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.

24
	

III,5,2209
	

Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.

25
	

III,5,2213
	

Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.

26
	

III,5,2218
	

Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,
The gallant, young and noble gentleman,
The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.

27
	

III,5,2230
	

Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,
And see how he will take it at your hands.

28
	

III,5,2246
	

Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
I would the fool were married to her grave!

29
	

III,5,2265
	

Fie, fie! what, are you mad?

30
	

III,5,2287
	

You are too hot.

31
	

III,5,2317
	

Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:
Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.

32
	

IV,2,2533
	

No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.

33
	

IV,2,2536
	

We shall be short in our provision:
'Tis now near night.

34
	

IV,3,2555
	

What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?

35
	

IV,3,2562
	

Good night:
Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.

36
	

IV,4,2613
	

Hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse.

37
	

IV,4,2625
	

Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
But I will watch you from such watching now.

38
	

IV,5,2671
	

What noise is here?

39
	

IV,5,2673
	

What is the matter?

40
	

IV,5,2675
	

O me, O me! My child, my only life,
Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
Help, help! Call help.

41
	

IV,5,2681
	

Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!

42
	

IV,5,2688
	

O woful time!

43
	

IV,5,2702
	

Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!

44
	

V,3,3164
	

The people in the street cry Romeo,
Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,
