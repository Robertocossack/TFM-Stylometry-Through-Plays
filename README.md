# TFM-Stylometry-Through-Plays

This project its aimed at geting some insights over the capavility of classical theater authors 
in terms of character discrimination, and offer a descriprion as deep as possible of this phenomena.

With this purpose I've made use of stylometric analysis to explore the plays of six authors in two different languages. 
Specifically, the techniques related with authorship attribution were put into play, attending mostly to lexical 
structure and vocabulary used, by methods which have been previpously validated in the domain of authorship atribution.

A markdown, under the name of work_report, with all the necessary information to run the code and go through the analysis and results its provided.
